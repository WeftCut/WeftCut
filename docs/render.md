# Render

The PixiJS + WebCodecs renderer. One module produces every frame the
user ever sees — in the live preview surface and in the export
Worker. Preview pixels equal export pixels by construction.

This doc covers the architecture. For the preview-side mount + clock
+ transport see [`preview.md`](preview.md). For the audio export +
final mux see [`export.md`](export.md).

## Boundaries

- **In scope:** visual compositing — video clips, image overlays,
  text (including caption cues), color fills, transforms, opacity, blend
  modes, transitions.
- **Out of scope:** audio (the buffer-scheduled Web Audio preview mixer
  + Rust export mixer; [`audio.md`](audio.md)), file muxing (handled by
  ffmpeg `-c copy`), source probing / proxy generation / waveforms /
  thumbnails (all Rust-side).
- **Per-layer effects:** each layer carries an ordered `effects` chain of
  Pixi filters, drawn from a catalog spanning four picker categories — blur,
  keying, colour, stylise. Two catalog entries are shaders authored here
  (chroma key, sharpen); the rest wrap stock Pixi filters. The compositor
  attaches them to the layer's sprite per frame; the renderer owns the filter
  *catalog* (`render/effects/effectRegistry.ts`) while the project state holds
  the effect *instances* and their keyframeable params (authored in the TS
  actor, mirrored to Rust for export). See
  [ADR 0027](adr/0027-per-layer-effects-pixi-filter-chains.md).

## Compositor

`Compositor` owns a PixiJS `Application` (or the headless equivalent
in the export Worker). Its public surface:

```ts
class Compositor {
  // `openId` names the composition to draw; omitted / unknown ⇒ the root.
  setProject(summary: ProjectSummary, openId?: string | null): void;
  setMediaSources(urls: Record<MediaId, string>): void;
  render(tUs: number): void;          // composite one frame at this time
}
```

The Compositor draws ONE composition through a `CompositionNode`, and holds
what every node shares: the decoder pool, the ingest shaders, the audio bus,
the Motif prewarm/bake planners, underrun accounting, presentation state.

Each call to `setProject` hands the node a new snapshot: layers that
disappeared dispose their sprites, new layers spawn a Sprite of the right
kind on the next sweep, survivors get their `LayerSummary` patched in place.
Z-order follows the track + within-track index the project summary already
carries. A `setProject` naming a DIFFERENT composition rebuilds the node
instead — every sprite, mixer and decode session belonged to the timeline
being left.

`render(tUs)` walks the node's layers in z-order. For each layer the
Compositor first resolves the view's `AnimTrack<T>` properties at the
layer-local time via `render/resolveView.ts` — numeric tracks through
`render/animated.ts`'s `resolveAnimated`, color tracks through its
`resolveAnimatedColor` twin (OkLab + premultiplied alpha), both calling
the shared `weftcut-eval` wasm (the SAME crate Rust links natively, so
there is one keyframe engine, not a hand-mirrored pair;
[ADR 0025](adr/0025-shared-eval-wasm-leaf-crate.md)) — then
hands the resolved scalar view to the sprite to update its texture /
position / opacity / transform / blend mode. The leaf resolves
`Bezier{p1,p2}` segments (including every baked named preset — see
`src/shared/easing.ts`) through one WebKit-`UnitBezier` cubic solver
(Newton–Raphson with binary-search fallback), and the procedural
`Elastic`/`Bounce` segments through closed-form Penner math on the same
libm-only discipline, so spline and parameter curves alike are identical
in preview, export, and Rust by construction. The curve-graph editor
overlay samples its curves through the same wasm eval — there is no JS
solver copy anywhere. The golden-vector fixture
(`render/animatedGolden.fixture.json`) is a single-source regression:
the TS suite (`animated.golden.test.ts`, through wasm) and the Rust leaf
test both assert the wasm/native engine reproduces it, spline and
procedural cases alike.

**Known limit:** the wasm preview holds at most 256 keyframes **per animated
property** (one `AnimTrack` — e.g. a single layer's opacity or x, NOT a whole
track or clip; mirrors `MAXKF` in `native/eval/src/wasm.rs`). It is a
static-allocation backstop for the no_std wasm, not a product limit — manual
authoring stays in the single digits. Beyond 256 the preview truncates while
native export still evaluates every keyframe, so the two would diverge;
`loadTrack` (`MAX_KEYFRAMES`) emits a one-time `console.warn` if a property ever
exceeds it. Revisit (an upstream per-property cap, or a linear-memory upload
path) only if dense/programmatic keyframes are ever generated.

### Compositions: the recursive composite

A **Group** is a composition placed as one media-bearing layer
(`CompositionRef`) in another; the root and every Group share one shape
(`Project.compositions` + `root_id`), so there is one drawing path, entered at
a different node ([ADR 0052](adr/0052-link-propagates-group-composes.md)).

- **One `CompositionNode` per Group LAYER**, not per composition. Two
  placements of one composition sit at different offsets, so at a single
  playhead they show two different frames of the same content — two decode
  positions, two rings, two sets of sprites. Anything a node hands to a shared
  service is keyed per instance: `instanceKey(path, layerId)`, which is the
  bare layer id at the root, so a flat project's pool and bake keys are
  unchanged.
- **Render to texture.** `CompositionRefSprite` composites its child node into
  a `RenderTexture` of the composition's own `width × height` and shows it in
  one `Sprite`, which the parent stages through the same `stageVisual` every
  other visual kind goes through — so transform, opacity, blend, the effect
  chain and the transition divert apply to one flat image, and a Group's own
  transitions resolve inside its frame before the parent sees it. Nesting
  therefore composes transforms by construction. The target is 8-bit
  (`bgra8unorm` on WebGPU — the same pipeline constraint the transition node
  hits), so the 10-bit lane quantizes through a Group.
- **Time.** Parent `t` ↔ child `t − t_start + src_in`, re-snapped to the
  shared lattice on the way down (`compositionLocalUs`): grid anchors are
  `round(frame × 1e6 × den / num)`, so an offset that is itself a difference
  of anchors lands a µs off the child's own grid, and a child layer starting
  there would read as not yet active for exactly one frame. Past the
  composition's `duration_us` the node composites nothing and the texture
  clears to transparent — overhang is tolerated in state and rendered as
  nothing.
- **Audio** runs in the same recursion: a layer inside a Group is placed at
  its root-time interval, clipped to the Group's window, and reads its source
  `headUs` in — so the mixers need no notion of Groups. `enabled = false` on
  the Group layer silences everything below it that same frame.
- **Preview draws the FOCUSED composition** (`state/compositionAnchorStore.ts`)
  — the one whose timeline Panel last held the keyboard; the frame size, the
  fps binding and the playhead's bound follow it, so entering a Group shows its
  content unscaled at its own size, on its own clock. **Export always draws the
  root**, whatever has focus: a Group is a
  source, and a file of one alone is a file nobody asked for.
- **Every flat `tracks[].layers[]` walk that has to see inside a Group** goes
  through `compositionWalk.ts` — the export decode set and the emptiness gate
  (`activeVideoLayers.ts`), the Motif pre-bake (`exportBake.ts`), font
  collection (`worker/runExport.ts`), the Motif prewarm/bake planners. It
  reports each leaf at its ROOT-time placement, clipped to the intersection of
  the entered Groups' windows, with what the clipping cut off the head and
  tail; a consumer turns that into a source trim. The Compositor's own sweep
  does not use it: a node walks its one composition and recurses through its
  child nodes, because it owns sprites per instance. Twin:
  `native/src/audio/mix.rs` `for_each_audio_layer` — same offset and window
  convention, same depth cap (`MAX_COMPOSITION_DEPTH`).

### Keyframe easing authoring

Easing is shown and edited directly on the timeline. Each animated property's
keyframe sub-lane draws its value over time as a curve; focusing a property
expands its lane and exposes tangent handles on each keyframe (left = the
previous segment's outgoing control point, right = this segment's). Dragging a
handle edits that segment's `cubic-bezier`. The curve follows the value, so
which segment an easing governs is read directly from the picture.

Right-clicking a keyframe or segment opens a two-tier menu (`EasingMenu`).
Tier 1 is the NLE-conventional command list — Linear / Hold / Ease In / Ease
Out / Ease In-Out / Smooth — with the exact reverse lookup checkmarking the
current state (a gallery-only preset checkmarks the "Easing library…" row
instead). Tier 2, behind that row, is the full canonical preset table as a
family-grouped grid of curve thumbnails, each sampled through the same wasm
eval that draws the timeline curve; hovering a thumbnail previews it live on
the owning segment via `easingPreviewStore`, and an Elastic keyframe's
amplitude/period sliders sit at the top of the gallery. Keyframe markers also
glyph-code their outgoing interpolation, per the Premiere convention: diamond =
linear, square = hold, circle = eased (`interpGlyphClass`), on both the
collapsed in-clip row and the sub-lane dots.

Each expanded sub-lane header also carries an After Effects-style keyframe
navigator — `◄ ◆ ►` — to the left of the property name. The arrows seek the
playhead to the previous / next keyframe of that property and select it; the
middle diamond toggles a keyframe at the playhead (filled when one sits there →
click removes it; hollow → click adds one at the current value), and is disabled
when the playhead is off the clip. The navigator acts on the focused clip, or
the sole keyframed clip when a track row spans several. Unlike the inspector
stopwatch, which turns a property's animation on or off, the navigator only adds
and removes keys on an already-animated property.

The same expanded sub-lane header also exposes the property's value at the
playhead as a compact, editable number field beside the navigator — on the
focused row only; collapsed rows stay navigator-and-label. Typing a value, or
stepping it with the arrows, writes a keyframe at the playhead (creating one if
none sits there, updating it if one does) — the same auto-key the inspector
performs — and the field is disabled when the playhead is off the clip. The
inspector's value rows and this timeline field are one shared control,
`KeyframeField`, driven by each property's descriptor (which widgets — number,
slider, readout — plus step and bounds); the inspector wraps it with the
stopwatch, the timeline renders it compact without one.

## Decoder pool

`SourceDecoderPool` is two-tiered. Decoders + frame rings are keyed
by `layerId` (one `SourceHandle` per clip), while the underlying
mediabunny `Input` + `EncodedPacketSink` (and the resolved
`VideoDecoderConfig` from `getDecoderConfig()`) live on a refcounted
`SourceMedia` keyed by `mediaId`. Multiple clips of the same source —
including overlapping copies on different tracks — each get their own
`VideoDecoder` / `FrameRing` / `PacketPump` but share one opened input.

A decoder is created on first `requestFrameAt(tUs)` against its
handle and reused for every subsequent request from that clip. The
hardware-decode fallback path stays the same as before:

- **First-frame error (output count = 0):** reset the decoder with
  `hardwareAcceleration: 'prefer-software'` and mark the handle as
  downgraded.
- **`'Codec reclaimed due to inactivity'`:** close + null the
  decoder, emit one LogBus warning, lazy-rebuild on next
  `requestFrameAt`.

Each handle's `FrameRing` caches the most recent 1 s lookahead /
0.5 s lookbehind. The ring is what the compositor reads — decoder
threads stay one step ahead of the playhead.

The ring stores `ImageBitmap` snapshots, not `VideoFrame`s.
`SourceHandle.output` runs `createImageBitmap(frame)` and closes the
source `VideoFrame` on resolve — this returns the WebCodecs hardware
decoder's buffer slot to its pool. Caching `VideoFrame`s directly
would pin the pool (~13 slots on common desktop GPUs) at the ring's
held count, exhaust it within a few frames, and stall the decoder
silently. The ffmpeg engine's software lane rings `NativeNv12Frame`s
instead — its CPU planes must convert in the compositor's own
`Nv12Ingest` pass, never through `createImageBitmap` (ADR 0032) — and
the ring treats both kinds alike through their shared `close()`. The
export-side `ExportFrameStore` keeps `VideoFrame`s because its
consumer closes them immediately after each encoded frame, so the
pool stays drained without snapshotting; both stores satisfy a shared
`FrameStore` interface that returns a `DecodedFrame`
(`VideoFrame | ImageBitmap | TenBitFrame | NativeNv12Frame`). The union,
its type guards, and the dims helper live together in
`renderer/render/decoder/decodedFrame.ts` — a new frame kind extends
that module first, and the compiler then surfaces every consumer
branch. Its `BrowserConvertibleFrame` subset (`VideoFrame |
ImageBitmap` — the kinds a 2D-canvas `drawImage` converts correctly)
is what `VideoClipSprite.updateFrame` accepts, so routing a CPU-plane
kind into the snapshot path is a compile error. Frames do not carry
authoritative timing: each store's entries record `ptsUs`/`durationUs`
alongside the frame (an `ImageBitmap` has no timestamp field, and
WebCodecs may null a frame's `duration`). See ADR 0004.

Idle handles are disposed 5 s after the last `requestFrameAt` and
recreated on demand. The shared `SourceMedia` is freed only once its
refcount falls to 0 (the last referencing handle has disposed), at
which point the sample table + any resident GOP-block byte cache are
released.

### Byte handling

The source is never fully resident in memory. The mediabunny `Input`
reads through a `weftcut-media://` Range `CustomSource` (`AssetRangeSource`):
each read issues an HTTP `Range` request and returns exactly the
requested bytes. The `weftcut-media:` custom protocol handler (registered
in the main process) honors Range — the same path HTML5 `<video>` seeks
through — whereas a plain `fetch(url)` buffers the whole body before
exposing `body.getReader()`, defeating streaming.

One Range caveat: `AssetRangeSource.read` loops, re-issuing Range
requests until it has the exact byte count mediabunny asked for — a
single short read would hand the decoder truncated data and wedge it.

mediabunny owns the demux and byte cache; there is no resident sample
table and no manual block LRU (the prior mp4box era's `sampleAt` /
`ensureBlocksLoaded` / GOP-block cache are gone). The `PacketPump`
pulls packets via `getKeyPacket(tsSeconds)` / `getNextPacket(packet)`,
both of which `await` any uncached Range read natively — a cache miss
awaits the bytes instead of returning a transient null. The reset
decision (`decideReset`, ADR 0003) is synchronous and key-packet-free;
only the reset *action* fetches a key packet. See ADR 0002 for the
mediabunny demux/mux adoption.

### Why per-clip decoders

The pool used to key everything by `mediaId` — every clip of the
same source shared one decoder + ring. That assumed "only one clip
of a source is under the playhead at a time," which holds for
sequential cuts on a single track but breaks the moment overlapping
copies of one source appear on the timeline (a common A/B-roll
move). `Compositor.setAnchorTime` fires `requestFrameAt(srcTUs_i)`
for every clip under the playhead; with one shared ring, N
overlapping clips of the same media wrote N conflicting anchors per
tick, the ring evicted its own contents, and the decoder reset once
per overlapping clip per tick — observable as a continuous
`[weftcut/pixi] decoder reset:` log spam with no clip ever painting
a stable frame.

Per-clip decoders give each layer a stable anchor + lookahead at the
cost of a per-clip hardware decode session, well within the 8–32
concurrent sessions modern Windows H.264 / HEVC stacks expose.

### Future optimisation: shared decoder across sequential cuts

The cost the current design pays is cold-start latency at every cut.
Blade-splitting one clip into two layers gives each half its own
decoder, so playback crossing the cut warms a fresh decoder for the
second half (~100–300 ms first-frame). The pre-refactor design
happened to hide this because both halves rode one already-warm
decoder.

The optimisation is to detect "same `mediaId`, contiguous
source-time, sequential timeline-time" pairs at acquire-time and let
the second clip continue the first clip's `SourceHandle` across the
cut boundary instead of constructing its own. Constraints:

- Same `mediaId`.
- `layer_b.params.src_in_us` ≈
  `layer_a.params.src_in_us + (layer_a.t_end_us − layer_a.t_start_us)`
  (source-time stays contiguous across the cut, within one project
  frame).
- `layer_b.t_start_us` ≈ `layer_a.t_end_us` (timeline-time also
  contiguous within one project frame).
- Neither clip reverses, skips, or rate-changes the source (i.e.
  default `1.0×` forward playback only).

When all four hold, the cut is functionally a no-op for the decoder
and a single warm pipeline can serve both layers. When any
constraint fails — e.g. the user deliberately overlaps two cuts of
one source on different tracks for split-screen — the current
per-clip path applies.

v1 doesn't ship this. The "cold decoder at every cut" penalty is
acceptable for typical timelines; revisit if cuts dominate user
projects and the latency becomes user-visible during scrub or
preview.

## Scrub

`scrub.ts`'s `ScrubCoalescer` debounces drag input — a quiet-period
timer plus a max-wait ceiling, so an unbroken drag still re-targets the
decoder a few times a second instead of freezing on the last frame
until the user pauses. On a stable target the `PacketPump` resets to
the prior key packet (via `getKeyPacket`) and decodes forward to the
requested frame. The short proxy GOP (ADR 0008) bounds that to a few
frames, so each re-target lands within ~1 frame-time and decode-during-
drag works without churn.

## Playhead updates

The engine emits the playhead position once per composition frame during
playback (`PlaybackEngine.emitTime`). That stream fans out through
`renderer/state/playheadStore.ts` — a zustand store — and deliberately
never through React state above a leaf component: a frame-rate value in
App-level state re-renders the entire tree 30–60×/s while playing, which
is a straight CPU tax in production and, under the React development
build, additionally ratchets renderer memory (native-side, GC-immune)
for as long as playback runs.

Consumers pick the cheapest tier that fits (rules and examples in the
store's header):

1. **Event-time reads** — `playheadTimeUs()` inside handlers (seek
   shortcuts, insert-at-playhead, drag/blade snapping). No subscription.
2. **Transient subscriptions** — smooth per-frame visuals (the timeline
   playhead line, the transport timecode readout) subscribe via
   `usePlayheadStore.subscribe` in an effect and mutate the DOM node
   through a ref. Zero React commits during playback.
3. **Throttled hook** — `usePlayheadTimeUsThrottled()` for panels that
   show "value at playhead" (inspector, Playhead Panel, keyframe headers).
   Trailing-edge, so a pause or single seek converges on the exact
   final frame.
4. **Frame-rate hook** — `usePlayheadTimeUs()` only for tiny leaf
   subtrees (agent-mode MiniTimeline).

When adding any UI that follows the playhead, start at tier 1 and only
move down the list when the UI genuinely needs to repaint continuously.

Enforcement: `apps/desktop/e2e/scripts/memory-ratchet.mjs` (local-only —
the phenomenon is dev-bundle-specific, so the prod-built e2e suite
cannot see it; needs the dev server on port 1420). It replays a 90 s
playback against a synthesized no-media fixture and fails when the
post-GC memory floor rises ≥ 30 MB. Run it after touching the playback
loop, the playhead store, or anything that subscribes per frame.

It takes a scenario argument, each guarding a different per-frame allocation
class: `text` (the React-subscription ratchet above), `transitions` (the
two-input node's RenderTexture pool), `text-box` (the shrink-to-fit search
re-measuring), `groups` (a composition placed twice and once more through a
nesting Group — three `CompositionNode`s, three render targets). Run the one
whose class your change touches.

## Sprite kinds

| Sprite | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VideoClipSprite` | `FrameRing` snapshot → `Texture` | Consumes the `DecodedFrame` returned by `FrameStore.frameAt` — `ImageBitmap` (WebCodecs preview, native GPU lane) and `VideoFrame` (export) are snapshotted into a sprite-owned canvas before upload (see the snapshot rule below); CPU-plane kinds (`NativeNv12Frame`, `TenBitFrame`) bypass the snapshot entirely — `updateFrame` accepts only the `BrowserConvertibleFrame` subset, and the Compositor routes CPU-plane kinds through their owned ingest shaders to `bindExternalTexture` (ADR 0032). |
| `ImageOverlaySprite` | `createImageBitmap` / `ImageDecoder` → `Texture` | Two branches. **Still images:** one-shot `createImageBitmap` at sprite spawn; texture cached for the layer's lifetime. **Animated images (GIF, animated WebP, APNG, animated AVIF):** `decodeAnimatedImage` decodes all frames once via WebCodecs `ImageDecoder` (downscaled to composition size) and caches the resulting `DecodedAnimation` per `mediaId`. Each `render(tUs)` call selects the frame whose cumulative native delay covers `tInLayerUs mod totalDuration` (via `gifFrameIndexAt`) — looping at native speed to fill the layer. The same sprite class and the same `Compositor` run inside the export Worker, so export animation is inherent; the Worker awaits `preloadImages()` before starting the encode loop. |
| `TextSprite` | PixiJS `Text` (native canvas) | Shadow via drop-shadow filter; outline via stroke option; intro / outro presets are sprite-side animation. Wrap width and the block's placement inside the layout box are the sprite's own — see [Text layout](#text-layout-the-box) below. Caption cues imported from SRT/VTT/ASS files are ordinary `Text` layers and render through this same sprite — no separate subtitle path exists (see [`captions.md`](captions.md)). Bundled fonts (Liberation Sans, Noto Sans SC) are loaded into the export Worker before the encode loop so burned-in captions never tofu. |
| `MotifSprite` | CDP-captured PNG frame → `Texture` | Binds the Motif's frame for the playhead's layer-relative time (on demand, RAM lookahead, or persisted PNG); frames come from the webcap CDP capture path, not an in-process raster; see [`motifs.md`](motifs.md). |
| `ColorSprite` | PixiJS `Graphics` rect | Animated fill color. |

### Text layout: the box

Text is the only visual kind with no intrinsic size, so `TextParams` carries a
layout box — `box_w`, `box_h`, in composition pixels, local (pre-`scale`).
Which fields are set *is* the resize mode; there is no enum to contradict them
(ADR 0049):

| `(box_w, box_h)` | Mode | `wordWrap` |
|---|---|---|
| `(null, null)` | Auto width | off |
| `(set, null)` | Auto height | on |
| `(set, set)` | Fixed | on |

`(null, set)` is not a mode. `TextSprite` coalesces it to Auto width — the
renderer half of a pair whose other half is a structured refusal in
`main/state/mutations/params.ts`, so a hand-edited project cannot blank the
frame mid-render. Bogus `align`/`valign` values and non-finite box, leading or
tracking numbers are coalesced the same way, because the failure they produce
is a NaN transform, i.e. a layer that vanishes rather than one that looks
wrong.

**The block is placed inside the box, and that is not what `align` alone
does.** Pixi's rendered block is `maxLineWidth` wide (plus stroke and shadow) —
never `wordWrapWidth` — so `TextStyle.align` only distributes lines *within*
the block. `TextSprite.blockAnchorInBox` supplies the missing half: it offsets
the block inside the box from `align` (horizontal) and `valign` (vertical), and
expresses the result as a Pixi `anchor` renormalized over the block. `anchor`
rather than `pivot` on purpose — a pivot would also move the point rotation and
scale turn about, which stays `(x, y)`. With no box the box *is* the block, the
offset is zero, and the anchor is returned unchanged, so Auto width renders
bit-for-bit what it did before the box existed.

`Compositor.naturalSizeOf` asks the sprite for that same rectangle, so the
on-canvas gizmo draws the box being dragged rather than the glyphs inside it.

**CJK breaking is realm-global, and that decides where it is installed.** Pixi's
wrap unit is a space-delimited token and `CanvasTextMetrics.canBreakWords`
returns the style's `breakWords` (false), so an unspaced Chinese sentence is
one token that never wraps at any width — the box is inert in Chinese.
`fonts/lineBreak.ts` overrides that static: breakable if the style says so *or*
the token contains CJK, which wraps Chinese per character and English per word.
`breakWords: true` is not the alternative; it splits Latin words.

Because the hook is a class static it has to be set in every realm that
rasterizes text, or preview wraps where export does not. That needs exactly one
install site, not one per realm: every such realm builds a `Compositor` — the
export Worker included — so the constructor's unconditional call is
realm-complete by construction. It sits *outside* the preview-only font branch
and must stay there; the hook needs neither `document` nor a `FontFaceSet`, and
gating it on those is the defect itself.
`e2e/electron/text-box-cjk-export.spec.ts` is the gate: it exports the same CJK
string twice, relying on auto-wrap once and spelling the line breaks out with
`\n` the other, and SSIM-compares the two videos. Both legs come from the same
realm, so it needs no fixture media and no calibrated floor — an export that
failed to wrap renders one long clipped line and diverges.

**Shrink-to-fit belongs to Fixed alone.** Fixed is the only mode that can fail
to contain its text, and it responds by shrinking the glyphs: `TextSprite`
binary-searches the largest whole-pixel font size whose measured block fits the
box (`textBox.ts`'s `fitFontSize`, measured through
`CanvasTextMetrics.measureText` — canvas measurement, no rasterization, no GPU)
and renders at that size. Whole pixels rather than a fractional bisection: the
search terminates on the range itself with no epsilon to tune, and the set of
sizes it can mint stays finite, so Pixi's measurement cache cannot become a
growth term. The floor is an absolute 8 px (`TEXT_BOX_MIN_PX`, the same number
as the `box_w` drag floor) — at the floor the text overflows and the sprite
reports it rather than shrinking further, and an authored size already below the
floor is never *enlarged* toward it. Auto height narrower than one glyph
overflows **horizontally** instead of shrinking, which is what keeps a caption
at exactly the size its style asked for.

The factor also multiplies `outline.width`, the shadow's offsets and blur, and
the leading and tracking: everything authored in pixels *against the glyphs*
compresses with them, for one reason wearing several faces — an absolute 4 px
outline around text compressed to 43% reads as a smeared border, and an absolute
80 px leading over 8 px glyphs reads as broken spacing.
`native/src/subtitles/layout.rs` already treats an outline as `size * 0.06` at
import, so an absolute width surviving the compression would contradict the
importer's own model. Scaling the leading is also what lets the search converge
at all: an absolute height term no bisection can shrink drives a box shorter than
one authored line to the floor however small the glyphs get. `line_height: 0`
means auto — the font's own metrics — and 0 survives any factor, so the default
path is untouched.

None of this reaches state: the layer keeps exactly the font size the user set,
because an MCP `content` edit never passes through the renderer, which would
leave a stored size stale from the next word typed. The search lives inside
`TextSprite`'s `appliedSig` gate, whose signature already carries every
measurement input, so an unchanged box costs zero re-measures per frame; the
winning probe's `TextStyle` becomes the applied style, since `styleKey` is
per-instance and a freshly minted twin would miss the measurement cache.
`GizmoProbe.textFitOf` reads the result back for the inspector's reduced-size
notice and the gizmo's box stroke.

### Frame upload: the snapshot rule

**Never bind a raw `VideoFrame` to a Pixi texture.** Pixi's default
WebGPU upload (`copyExternalImageToTexture`) drops the frame's
`colorSpace` and converts every frame with a fixed BT.709/limited
formula. For a 601 or full-range frame that is a destructive pixel
mis-convert — wrong RGB values baked into the composite, which no
downstream re-tagging can repair — not a recoverable metadata error.
The browser's 2D-canvas paths (`drawImage`, `createImageBitmap`) do
honor a **decoder-produced** frame's matrix/range, so both surfaces
route those through one of them before Pixi ever sees pixels:

- **Preview** converts at decode output: `SourceHandle.output` runs
  `createImageBitmap(frame)` (which also returns the decoder's buffer
  slot — ADR 0004), so the `FrameRing` already holds correct RGB.
- **Export** holds raw `VideoFrame`s for pool-drain reasons, so
  `VideoClipSprite` snapshots each frame into its sprite-owned
  `OffscreenCanvas` via a synchronous `drawImage` and binds the canvas.

The delegation stops at decoder-produced frames: a BUFFER-defined
frame (the native lanes' CPU planes) is converted by Chromium as
BT.601 regardless of its stamped `colorSpace`, so those ride their own
frame kinds (`NativeNv12Frame`, `TenBitFrame`) through owned ingest
shaders on both surfaces instead — never through this snapshot path,
whose `BrowserConvertibleFrame` parameter excludes them at compile
time (ADR 0032).

ADR 0014 records the evidence: reverting the export snapshot scores
~22 on the perceptual conformance gate vs ≈0 with it.

**The zero-copy alternative is deliberately parked at lowest
priority, and the preview-side profiling that would justify it says
no.** `importExternalTexture` does honor the matrix — a standalone
POC confirmed Chromium samples 601 and 709 to distinct RGB through
`textureSampleBaseClampToEdge` — so the idea is sound; it just isn't
worth anything measured. Colour correctness is already handled at
zero marginal cost, because the snapshot *is* the honoring
conversion, and the blit it would remove is a rounding error:
`blitDrawImage` means 0.03 ms per frame at 1080p and 0.02 ms at 4K,
p95 ≤ 0.2 ms, against a 16.7 ms budget
([playback-perf](playback-perf.md)). The replacement, meanwhile, is
heavy — a bespoke Pixi pass re-importing the per-frame
`GPUExternalTexture` (it expires every frame), a permanent WebGL
dual-path because export has no `navigator.gpu`, bilinear-only
sampling with no mips, and a fresh colour-conformance pass.

**Export is the one case that could reopen it**, and it is still
unmeasured: `__weftcutExportPerf` `compositeMs` is the instrument,
and 4K export is where the blit would matter. Do not start without
that number. The staged plan, if it ever arrives, lives in the issue
tracker, not here.

The snapshot rule is one instance of the project-wide color model —
color converges once at an explicit, gated chokepoint and the rest of
the pipeline is color-naive (ADR 0021).

## Motifs

A Motif is a parameterized, time-varying web overlay (a lower-third, a
countdown, a title card). Because the export Worker has no DOM, a Motif is
captured to a bitmap on the **main process** for both surfaces: the export
Worker receives the bitmaps rather than producing them, so one capture path
feeds preview and export and preview-equals-export holds.

`MotifSprite` obtains the frame for the playhead's layer-relative time
(captured on demand, from a RAM lookahead ring, or from a persisted PNG
sequence) and binds it as a texture; the layer transform and opacity are
applied to the sprite. Capture drives the Motif's page to time `t` in an
offscreen Electron window and grabs a PNG via the DevTools Protocol
(`webContents.debugger`, `Page.captureScreenshot`) — a real browser raster.
The frame is byte-identical across runs and across OS at a fixed `t`, so the
cache holds one capture per frame index.

A Motif's `index.html` + manifest (+ optional `assets/`) are embedded in the
Rust binary and served to the host over the `motif:` URI scheme; see
`crate::motifs` (`native/src/motifs/`). The catalog is surfaced to the
renderer via the `list_motifs` command and the MCP `list_motifs` tool.

See [`motifs.md`](motifs.md) for the authoring contract, the capture harness,
and the raster cache.

## Export Worker

`exportWorker.ts` is the Worker entry. It receives:

- An `OffscreenCanvas` transferred from the main thread.
- A `structuredClone`d `ProjectSummary` + media asset URL map.
- A `VideoEncoderConfig` (built from
  `defaultEncoderConfig(width, height)` on the main thread).
- A time range `[startUs, endUs)`.

The Worker mounts a `Compositor` against the OffscreenCanvas, points it at the
project's ROOT composition (never the editor's open one), walks the output
frame grid for that half-open range, calls `render(tUs)` for each frame, and
captures each output `VideoFrame` with
`timestamp = tUs - startUs` so the encoded video starts at zero. The
grid uses the exact rational output fps (`frameGrid.ts`), not
`i * round(1e6 / fps)`, so trim tails and 29.97/59.94-style rates do
not drift or over-count.

Encoded chunks stream through mediabunny `Output` using an
`EncodedVideoPacketSource` and an append-only stream target. The Worker
posts each fMP4 slice as a `chunk` event and waits for a `chunk-ack` after
the main thread appends it to a temp `video.mp4`; this keeps long exports
off V8's single-ArrayBuffer size ceiling. Progress events fire on every
encoded frame; the final `done` event carries perf counters only, because the
file has already been streamed to disk.

The main thread then optionally awaits the Rust audio-only export into a
sibling temp audio file and asks Rust to stream-copy mux both into the user's
chosen output; see [`export.md`](export.md).

### Export decode pipelines (one per media × phase)

The Worker drives an `ExportDecoderPool` in ~2 s chunks: per chunk it
dispatches every needed range per pipeline in one `decodeRange(aUs, bUs)`
call, then the encode loop awaits each output frame via `ring.waitForPts`
and evicts consumed frames. A pipeline is one of two handles behind the same
`ExportDecodeSession` contract, chosen per-acquire by the routing table
(see §Export source resolution):

- the WebCodecs `ExportSourceHandle` — an in-worker `VideoDecoder` over the
  clip's export source (no mid-export `decoder.flush()` — see the EOS-tail
  notes in `ExportDecoderPool.ts`); eviction keeps the ~13-slot WebCodecs
  buffer pool drained. Its `hardwareAcceleration` is platform-gated
  (`hwExportDecodeAllowed`, resolved on the main thread and riding the init
  protocol as `allowHwExportDecode`): Windows and macOS decode
  prefer-hardware — both hardware-verified faithful (Windows D3D11/NV12;
  macOS VideoToolbox NV12, force-tested through the conformance gate before
  joining the allowlist) — while Linux pins prefer-software, because on
  Linux/NVIDIA a hardware-decoded `VideoFrame` is an opaque GPU handle every
  JS read path silently zeros (black frames, no decoder error to trip the
  HW→SW fallback). The 10-bit lane pins software separately as a correctness
  requirement, and the error-driven HW→SW downgrade stays as the net for
  drivers that do error;
- the native `NativeExportSourceHandle` — a relay client: `decodeRange`
  becomes an IPC command to a credit-windowed `export_sw` session in the
  native component, which decodes the **original** and streams NV12/I420P10
  planes back main → renderer → Worker in-band and in order; the handle
  returns one credit per frame that leaves the ring. Its ordered `rangeEnd`
  carries the completed source range and finalizes quantized wait targets
  without decoding an out-of-range proof frame; `decodeRange` remains
  dispatch-only so the consumer can keep returning credits. A backward range
  starts a fresh decode generation and releases the prior generation's frames
  and credits. Frames convert to RGB in owned shaders, never by the browser
  (ADR 0032). Transport:
  [`export-ipc-transport.md`](export-ipc-transport.md); decision record:
  ADR 0033.

Pipelines are keyed by `exportHandleKey` = `mediaId` + the clip's
timeline→source offset (`src_in_us − t_start_us`, the *phase*), and the
Worker groups the chunk's active clips by that key, dispatching ONE
merged source range per group:

- **Same phase** (a stacked copy, or trims of one pass through the
  source): every clip wants the same source PTS at the same output time,
  so one decoder + ring serves them all and the extra copies cost no
  extra decode. Frame eviction takes the group **minimum** cutoff so no
  clip drops a frame a sibling still needs.
- **Different phase** (A/B-roll offsets of one source): the clips want
  source times a constant gap apart. One shared ring would have to hold
  the whole gap's worth of `VideoFrame`s — past ~13 frames that deadlocks
  the decoder's buffer pool — so each phase gets its own pipeline,
  mirroring the preview's per-clip keying.

The pool used to key handles by bare `mediaId`. Two enabled overlapping
clips of one source then raced a single handle — their concurrent
`decodeRange` calls interleaved on the shared packet cursor and each
clip's per-frame evict dropped frames the other still needed — and the
export's frame counter froze mid-run. The e2e gate is
`export_overlap_same_source.e2e.js`: stacked completion + no extra
dispatch vs the single-clip baseline, and offset completion + shifted
frame alignment in the offset clip's exclusive region.

With this grouping, dispatch sits on the inherent floor for every
forward-marching timeline shape — single-clip, sequential re-use,
different-phase overlap, and mid-GOP range entry, each measured against
its floor via the worker's `__weftcutExportPerf` counters during
development.
Source time per pipeline is `t + phase`, monotonic in `t`, so backward
re-seeks never fire in normal export; the residual costs — one decode
pass per phase, and the GOP-key prefix at a mid-GOP entry — are
properties of the content, not the scheduler.

### Export source resolution

Which engine and which file feed each pipeline is fixed before the Worker
launches, in two steps.

**Engine routing.** `resolveExportDecodeRouting`
(`render/exportDecodeRouting.ts`) runs once at export start in
`useExportFlow` — a pure function of the per-project `decodeEngine` intent
(`auto` / `ffmpeg` / `webcodecs`), native-component presence, the export's
composite bit depth, and each medium's persisted Decode Route. It emits a
per-media routing table that rides the init protocol into the Worker;
nothing re-resolves mid-run, and cross-engine or cross-source fallback
mid-export is forbidden — a native session error aborts the export loudly
(ADR 0033). Under `auto`, decodable sources stay on the in-worker WebCodecs
path and persisted blind spots route native, exporting the **original** with
no proxy involved; an `ffmpeg` pin routes every source native; a missing
component degrades the pin to `auto` (`effectiveSetting`). Native-routed
media skip the readiness machinery below entirely (`proxyWaitScope`), and
the export dialog's summary line ("N from originals, M from lossy proxy")
derives from this same table, so the dialog cannot disagree with the run.

**WebCodecs-lane readiness.** For the media the table leaves on WebCodecs,
`runExport.ts` resolves each clip's **export** source
(`exportPlaybackPathFor`): the original for a DirectExport or bypassed
source, otherwise the source-resolution export master (`proxy_path`).
Export never reads the quick preview proxy. For any clip whose export
source is a non-H.264 **original**, a main-thread **pre-flight**
(`probeSourceDecodable`) configures a decoder and decodes one key packet —
racing success against the decoder's error callback and a timeout
(WebCodecs can fail silently). If a source can't be decoded on this
machine, the Worker is never launched: the export aborts with a retry
message and `ensure_full_proxy` enqueues a proxy, so the retry succeeds
from the master. When the import sweep is already probing the same source,
the gate **defers to that in-flight probe** rather than opening a second
decoder — concurrent probes contend for the WebCodecs buffer pool and
false-negative a decodable source (ADR 0013). See ADRs 0010–0011, 0013.

### Encode exits

`resolveEncodeTarget` (`render/encodeTarget.ts`) is the one seam that decides
how the Worker's composited frames leave the process: a `NativeTarget { pixFmt }`
or a `WebCodecsTarget { workerCodec }`. `auto` — the default — always resolves
native, for every codec and bit depth; WebCodecs is reached only by an explicit
user pin, and only for an 8-bit delivery codec (H.264/HEVC/AV1) — WebCodecs
can emit neither an intermediate codec nor 10-bit, so the dialog disables the
conflicting options (the WebCodecs engine choice while an intermediate or
10-bit is selected; the intermediate codecs under a WebCodecs pin), and
`mergeSettings` snaps a stale or hand-edited saved blob that holds such a
combo back to `auto` on load. If the native sink fails to
start under `auto`, and the target was an 8-bit non-intermediate to begin with,
the user gets a consent-gated retry on WebCodecs; a pinned-native, 10-bit, or
intermediate failure, or a declined retry, is a hard error instead. The engine
is never swapped silently.

**Native (default).** The Worker forces the WebGL2 backend (the pack shaders
below need a GL renderer; the WebCodecs exit prefers WebGPU to match the
preview surface instead). After compositing, a GPU pack pass — `PackYuvPlanar`
for yuv420p/yuv422p/yuv422p10le, or the parity-gated `PackYuv420p10` for
yuv420p10le — writes the target's rawvideo bytes, read back asynchronously
(PBO + fence, two frames deep, `PboFrameReader`) so the Worker never blocks on
GPU completion; the bytes stream over the export `chunk`/`chunk-ack` IPC loop
into a native `ffmpeg` sink (`export/videosink.rs`);
see [`export-ipc-transport.md`](export-ipc-transport.md) for the transport.
The sink owns rawvideo input and the ffmpeg child lifecycle; it consumes one
complete `EncoderPlan` from `export/encoder_registry.rs`. The registry accepts
library-agnostic intent (codec, bit depth, acceleration, rate control, speed),
selects only adapters that pass a real one-frame probe, caches that selection,
and owns every output-side argument: bitrate with optional CBR bounds or CRF
quality mode, speed, GOP, per-library pixel format/profile mapping, container
tags, and the output-stream `bt709`/`limited` color tuple. The sink adds the
matching frame-side `setparams` filter. A removed or unusable encoder library
therefore yields structured `EncodeUnavailable` attempts; it is never replaced
by an assumed ffmpeg encoder name.

10-bit delivery (HEVC Main10 or AV1 10-bit, via the bit-depth selector) and
ProRes (always 10-bit) composite through an `rgba16float` render target instead
of the normal 8-bit one; DNxHR stays 8-bit. 10-bit-capable sources (H.264 Hi10P
and AV1 10-bit originals, detected by ffprobe metadata via `tenBitExportCapable`)
decode through a CPU-plane lane forced to software — for AV1 this is a
correctness requirement, since the hardware decoder "succeeds" but emits opaque
frames that can't `copyTo`. `TenBitIngest` uploads the extracted planes as RG8
textures and unpacks them into the f16 target via a GLSL pass; a reorder-margin
+ ring-high-water pair (`REORDER_MARGIN`, sized from resolution) keeps
the decoder fed ahead of the serialized copy chain without deadlocking, and
each simultaneous 10-bit source carries its own ring. The same reorder-margin
lead-in now applies to every export decode lane: software decoders hold the
trailing frames of a fed window until more input arrives (Chromium's macOS
prefer-software H.264 decoder withholds 2, 4 with B-frames), which otherwise
wedged each short-GOP chunk's final frame against `waitForPts`. This lane ships
**experimental**: the export-settings UI labels it and confirms the export
click, since the on-screen preview stays 8-bit/SDR (no HDR/wide-gamut preview
on the web platform) and the path runs below realtime — especially at 4K —
with HEVC Main10 source conform still pending (ADR 0022).

**WebCodecs (explicit pin only).** `VideoEncoder` receives each composited
`VideoFrame` from the PixiJS `OffscreenCanvas`, streams encoded chunks through
mediabunny `Output`, and the fMP4 slices land on disk via the chunk/
`writeFile(append)` loop. Color tags are whatever the encoder defaults to —
this exit has no equivalent assertion.

**Intermediates.** ProRes (`prores_ks`, profiles proxy/lt/422/hq, `yuv422p10le`)
and DNxHR (`dnxhd`, profiles lb/sq/hq, `yuv422p`) are native-only and MOV-only —
the dialog snaps the container to `.mov` and hides the bit-depth/CRF/preset/GOP
controls, since the profile alone fixes rate control (every frame is a
keyframe; there is no `-b:v` or `-g`).

Earlier revisions routed any codec/container WebCodecs couldn't emit directly
through an intermediate H.264 encode that ffmpeg then transcoded to the final
codec; once the native sink generalized to every bit depth and to the
intermediate codecs themselves, that path became redundant and was deleted.

The standing guard for all of the above is `export_codecs.spec.ts`, which
exercises AV1/HEVC direct, 10-bit HEVC, pinned-native H.264 with explicit color
tags, ProRes, and DNxHR through the real app and checks the resulting codec
shape, container, and (for the 10-bit case) distinct-step counts above the
8-bit ceiling at the analyzer's gradient-row meter.

Cross-reference: ADR 0022 records the f16-composite + native-encode-exit
decision and its probe-backed rationale (WebGL2 stock f16, copyTo ingest,
deferred HDR) — its transport section is superseded;
[`export-ipc-transport.md`](export-ipc-transport.md) describes the current
frame transport. ADR 0021 describes the color model this exit's frame+stream
tagging realizes for export.

### Backpressure

`encoder.encodeQueueSize > 8` → await one tick before submitting the
next frame. Prevents heap blow-up if the encoder lags decode.

### Hardware fallback

The encoder configures with `hardwareAcceleration: 'prefer-hardware'`
first. On configure error or a sustained zero-output condition the
Worker re-configures with `'prefer-software'` and logs a warning.

## Render & Play

A user-triggered affordance ("Render & Play") runs the export
pipeline into an OS temp `.mp4` and opens an Electron window
playing the file. The popup HTML lives at `/render-play.html`; the
URL hash carries the asset src + display path. Each invocation
allocates a unique window label so multiple plays coexist.

This is the WYSIWYG verification path when the user wants to see
exactly what the export will produce. It uses the same Worker + Rust
audio + mux pipeline the normal export does — same code, same
output.

## Fixture suite

`render/fixtures/runFixture.ts` is the reusable fixture runner. Each
fixture is a small project (a few seconds, hand-picked layers)
exercising one rendering concern. The runner exports the project
through the Worker, fishes specific frames out via the Rust
`extract_video_frame` command, and SSIM-compares each against a
committed baseline.

The fixture suite is the renderer's regression net — PixiJS is its
own ground truth (no comparison against ffmpeg), so the fixtures
must be re-baselined whenever an intentional rendering change lands.
