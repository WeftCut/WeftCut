# React/Electron docking layout research

## Question

Which existing layout manager best fits WeftCut's editor workspace: recursive
splits, tab stacks, edge/centre docking, resizable splitters, singleton panels,
named app-level workspace persistence, and a possible later path to floating or
secondary-window surfaces?

## Repository constraints

- The renderer is React 19.2 under `React.StrictMode`, Electron 44, ESM,
  TypeScript 6 with strict options, and an Electron sandbox with no Node globals.
- Timeline and preview sizing depends
  on `min-width: 0`, `min-height: 0`, and explicit overflow boundaries; a dock
  host must preserve those constraints.
- Media Pool to Timeline uses native HTML5 drag-and-drop with the custom
  `application/x-weftcut-media` MIME type. OS file drops use `Files`. Panel
  docking must not consume either drag class.
- Workspace JSON persistence follows the main-process-owned atomic-store
  pattern and remains outside project state and undo history.
- Renderer-created `window.open` is denied. Library popout features
  are therefore outside the supported workspace scope even if a candidate supports
  them.

Relevant local sources: [desktop dependencies](../../apps/desktop/package.json),
[workspace styling](../../apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles/workspace.css),
[editor mounting](../../apps/desktop/src/renderer/App.tsx), and
[window hardening](../../apps/desktop/src/main/windows.ts).

## Candidates

### Dockview

Dockview is the closest functional match. Its core model is panels inside groups
on a resizable grid. It supplies tab reordering, centre-to-stack and edge-to-split
docking, floating groups, popout groups, and JSON serialization. Panel IDs are
unique, which maps directly to WeftCut's one-instance-per-panel-kind rule.
Layout mutation events provide an explicit persistence seam, and `fromJSON` can
reuse existing panels rather than recreating their content.

Version 7 adds keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, focus recovery,
and keyboard docking. `dockview-react` declares React 19 compatibility and is
MIT licensed. The main trade-off is that layout mutation is performed through
an imperative `DockviewApi`, not an application-owned immutable React value.
WeftCut should wrap the API behind a small workspace adapter and persist only
the serialized form.

Dockview's built-in popouts open a same-origin browser window and require a
separate host page. That conflicts with WeftCut's current `window.open` denial
and does not solve the app's renderer-local playback/selection/GPU-preview
routing. Do not enable it. Its serialized floating/popout model is
still useful as a future seam.

### FlexLayout

FlexLayout is the strongest fallback. It exposes an explicit tree `Model`, JSON
round-tripping, typed model actions, action interception, unique node IDs,
splitters, tabsets, edge docking, component-state preservation during moves,
keyboard/ARIA behavior, and Playwright-tested stable layout selectors. Its
application-owned model is easier to reason about than Dockview's imperative
API and fits strict singleton validation well.

Its popout implementation uses React portals: content remains in the main
window's JavaScript realm and renders into another document. That can preserve
React state, but global `window`/`document` listeners, timers, resize observers,
and third-party portals need owner-document awareness. WeftCut has many direct
global listeners, and renderer `window.open` is denied, so this feature must
stay disabled.

### rc-dock

rc-dock supports saved layouts, docking moves, floating panels, and popup
windows, but the current package line is an alpha major and has a larger
dependency surface. It offers no decisive advantage over Dockview or
FlexLayout for this project.

### Lumino

Lumino's `DockPanel` is mature and actively maintained through JupyterLab, but
it is a general widget/message-loop framework rather than a React-first layout
component. Integrating React panels requires a widget/React bridge and adopts a
second UI lifecycle. That is justified for JupyterLab's plugin platform, not
for WeftCut's small fixed panel catalogue.

## Recommendation

Use **Dockview v7 behind a WeftCut-owned workspace adapter**. The adapter keeps
Dockview's imperative model and serialized form behind an application-owned
boundary; FlexLayout remains the documented alternative if a future Dockview
change can no longer be isolated there.

The integration must preserve all of the following:

1. React 19 StrictMode mounts each panel without duplicate registration or
   leaked subscriptions.
2. A tab can join a group, split on all four edges, resize, close, and reopen
   with a stable singleton panel ID.
3. `toJSON`/`fromJSON` round-trips the default and a deeply nested layout.
4. Media MIME drags and OS `Files` drops still reach their existing handlers.
5. Preview and Timeline correctly resize without overflow and without recreating
   the playback engine during an ordinary dock move.
6. Keyboard tab/group navigation remains usable after WeftCut theme overrides.

Do not expose Dockview's floating or popout commands. Do not let
library JSON become WeftCut's durable public schema directly: wrap it in a
versioned workspace record so a future library migration can be handled at one
boundary.
