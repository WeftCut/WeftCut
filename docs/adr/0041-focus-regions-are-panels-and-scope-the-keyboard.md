# A focus region is a Panel, DOM focus always lands on one, and that is what scopes the keyboard

## Context

The renderer had no notion of a focus *region*. Across `src/renderer` every
`tabIndex` was control-level — buttons, list items, dialog tab-lists — and no
main surface was focusable: not the timeline root, not the preview canvas, not
the media pool. Focus was therefore always in one of two bad states: parked on
a text input the user had visually left, or dropped on `<body>`, where no part
of the app owned the keyboard.

The reported symptom was narrow. Clicking a transform-gizmo handle did not
release the property field the user was typing in, so the typed value was never
applied — every field commits on blur. The mechanism is not obvious: the gizmo's
pointerdown handlers call `preventDefault()` to suppress native drag and text
selection, and a canceled `pointerdown` suppresses the compatibility `mousedown`
whose default action is what moves focus. The same shape sat in the keyframe
curve graph, the transition chip, the track-height splitter, and the layer
block. All of those `preventDefault()` calls are correct, and all of them stay.

Underneath the symptom, four independent mechanisms had grown to answer "who
owns this key":

1. The dispatcher's four knobs — `isEditableTarget`, `isInTransientWidget`,
   `captureGlobal`, `fireWhenEditing`.
2. Raw capture-phase `keydown` listeners racing each other with
   `stopImmediatePropagation()`: the keyframe diamond, the keyframe lane, the
   transition chip, the gizmo's Escape.
3. Selection-state mutual exclusion — clicking a clip body cleared the keyframe
   selection so that Delete "targets the layer again".
4. `blurAfterMouseActivation`, which dropped focus on `body` after a mouse
   activation because there was nowhere better to put it.

`captureGlobal`'s own comment named the missing piece: *Space must toggle
playback even when focus is parked on a menubar trigger / toolbar button after a
click.* The workaround existed because there was no region to hand focus back
to. And the three capture-phase Delete listeners had drifted apart — the
transition chip checked `isEditableTarget`, the two keyframe listeners did not,
so Delete aimed at a character in a text field silently removed a keyframe and
ate the keystroke.

## Decision

### A focus region is a dock Panel, and it needs no new taxonomy

`PANEL_REGISTRY` already enumerates the Panel kinds and `WeftCutPanelRenderer`
already wraps every Panel's content in one element, so the Panel root becomes
the region: `tabIndex={-1}` plus `data-focus-region={kind}`. One edit covers
every Panel, present and future.

The attribute is deliberately **separate from `data-panel-kind`**, which also
appears on the tab renderers — chrome, not regions. Keying regions off the
existing attribute would make a tab its own region.

`tabIndex={-1}` is load-bearing: a region is a programmatic focus target and
never a Tab stop, so it cannot swallow a Tab press or reorder the keyboard
walk. Its focus ring is suppressed, because a region gets focused on almost
every click and a ring there would read as "this whole panel is selected".
Which Panel owns the keyboard is already visible in Dockview's active-group tab
treatment.

### Focus release is a capture-phase `pointerdown` at `window`, and nothing else

`useFocusRegions` focuses the region root when a press lands on non-focusable
Panel content. Capture at `window` is the only phase that runs ahead of the
gesture handlers' `preventDefault()` — React attaches at the root container, a
descendant of window, so even React's capture handlers are later.

Releasing by *focusing the region* rather than by calling `blur()` is the whole
design. Blur-to-nowhere is what made `captureGlobal` necessary; landing focus on
a region means the keyboard always has a real owner, and the parked field's
blur — and therefore its commit — falls out as a side effect of the native focus
transfer.

Presses that would move focus on their own are left alone; `focusin` records
where they landed. Determining "would move focus" needs the region passed in
explicitly, because the region root is focusable by construction and Dockview's
wrappers above it may be too.

### A composite field is one focus group

`data-focus-group` marks a widget whose satellite controls belong to the focused
input: a NumberField's steppers, a clearable input's ✕, the sibling segments of
a timecode field. A press inside the group is not "outside the field".

Without it the model would actively break working behaviour. `AppInput`'s ✕
keeps focus with an `onMouseDown` preventDefault that a capture-phase listener
now precedes. And `AppTimecodeField` commits when focus leaves the whole
control, testing `relatedTarget` — which is null on a programmatic release — so
every segment-to-segment click would have committed the whole timecode, one undo
entry each.

### Escape reverts, and release is separate from revert

`Escape` in a field discards the edit and hands the keyboard back. The two
halves are deliberately different concerns: `useFocusRegions` always releases;
the *revert* belongs to the widget, so a field with no cancel semantics still
gives the keyboard back.

The release is deferred to the next task (`setTimeout(0)`): focusing the region
fires the field's blur, and a blur landing before the field's own Escape handler
would commit the value Escape was supposed to discard. A microtask is too early:
Chromium can checkpoint microtasks between the window capture listener and
React's root listener during real keyboard dispatch. The property-panel E2E
regression covers this ordering; jsdom's synchronous dispatch cannot reproduce
it. It is still a *capture*-phase listener, because a field may
`stopPropagation()` on keydown — the timeline rename input does — and a bubble
listener would never see the key.

`AppNumberField` needs no call-site cooperation: `lastCommitted`, captured on
focus rather than synced from `value`, already *is* the pre-edit snapshot, and
restoring it makes the release blur hit the existing dedup guard, so cancelling
cannot log an undo entry. `AppInput` cannot revert alone — the call site owns
`value` — so it takes an `onCancel` and the call site both restores its draft
and flags the imminent blur as a cancel. Inside a dialog, menu, or listbox no
field consumes Escape: there it closes the widget, and consuming it to revert
would strand the user one level in.

### `activeRegion` scopes the keyboard, strictly

`ActionDef.scope?: readonly PanelKind[]` gates dispatch on the region derived
from DOM focus. Absent means global: transport, seeking, mark in/out, tool
arming, save/export are app commands wherever focus sits.

The gate is **strict** — a scoped action yields whenever the active region is
not in its list, `null` included — and yields *without* `preventDefault`, like
every other stand-down, so the key stays available to whatever does own the
focused region. Strict is only safe because release lands focus on a real region
for every press on Panel content: a user who can see a selection has already
focused the Panel holding it.

`activeRegion` is the region of the last `focusin` and deliberately does **not**
reset on `focusout`. A control blurring to `<body>` — a menu closing, an element
unmounting, alt-tab away and back — leaves the last-touched Panel in charge,
which is what an NLE's panel highlight shows. `null` is reserved for focus
genuinely leaving every Panel, because that is the case the gate must catch.

Scoped to the timeline: `deleteSelected`, `copySelected`, `pasteAtPlayhead`,
`groupSelected`, `dissolveSelectedGroup`. The sub-frame audio nudges and resync
are deliberately left global — nudging audio sync while watching and listening
to the preview is the workflow those keys exist for, and scoping `Alt+Arrow` to
the timeline would kill it exactly when it is most useful.

### The capture-phase Delete preemptors owe the dispatcher's rules

The keyframe diamond, the keyframe lane, and the transition chip claim
Delete for a timeline *sub-selection* before the app-level delete-selected-layer
shortcut can see it. Winning that race is why they are raw capture-phase
listeners rather than catalogue entries — and the cost of bypassing the
dispatcher is that they must reproduce its stand-down rules by hand. Every rule
one of them forgets becomes "Delete does something different depending on which
selection happens to be armed". They now share one predicate,
`subSelectionDeleteYields`, carrying both of `deleteSelected`'s rules.

### `focusRegion.ts` must not import the Panel registry

The DOM primitives are imported by the shared field widgets, and
`panelRegistry` pulls in `../i18n` — which turned every widget into an i18n
consumer and broke suites that partially mock `react-i18next`. Region strings
leave that module raw; `useFocusRegions` narrows them to `PanelKind`.

## Consequences

- The reported bug is fixed at the mechanism rather than per call site: a new
  gesture handler cannot reintroduce it by forgetting a `blur()`, because no
  gesture handler participates.
- `captureGlobal` and `fireWhenEditing` stay, unchanged, but stop being the only
  tools available. New bare-key bindings can be scoped instead of fighting a
  parked control.
- **Strict scope has a test cost.** Any suite that renders a Panel's component
  in isolation and drives a scoped shortcut must declare the region, because
  there is no Panel wrapper to be one. Three existing tests needed that line.
  The alternative — a lenient gate that fires when no region owns the keyboard —
  would have made the gate untestable in exactly the harnesses that exercise it.
- Delete while the Attribute or Effect panel is focused now does nothing. The
  property panels edit the timeline selection, so an argument exists for
  widening `TIMELINE_SELECTION` to include them; it is a one-line change.
  Premiere and Resolve are strict, so strict is where this starts.
- Dockview's `activePanel` and `activeRegion` remain **separate**, and neither
  drives the other. `activePanel` is tab activation — what `focusNextPanel`
  moves and what the tab strip paints; `activeRegion` is keyboard ownership.
  Coupling them would mean either a focus move silently reordering tabs or a tab
  click stealing the keyboard from a field mid-edit.
- Dragging a native scrollbar counts as a press on Panel content, so it releases
  a focused field (and commits it). Wheel scrolling does not — it fires no
  `pointerdown`. A geometry test could exclude scrollbar presses if it ever
  bites; it is not worth pre-empting.
- The **selection-priority races are untouched**. Keyframe, transition, and
  layer Delete all live inside the timeline Panel, so region scope cannot
  disambiguate them; they share the region gate but still resolve their own
  priority by capture-phase ordering and selection mutual-exclusion.

## Where this lives

- `src/renderer/focus/focusRegion.ts` (DOM primitives, no React, no store —
  and no panel registry), `focusRegionStore.ts` (`activeRegion`),
  `useFocusRegions.ts` (the three listeners), mounted once in `main.tsx`'s
  `Root` so it also covers the startup screen.
- `src/renderer/workspace/DockWorkspace.tsx` (the Panel root becomes the
  region), `src/renderer/styles/workspace.css` (ring suppression).
- `src/renderer/shortcuts/match.ts` (`isEditableTarget` as a type predicate,
  `isInTransientWidget` lifted here so the field widgets can share it),
  `defs.ts` (`scope`, `TIMELINE_SELECTION`), `useShortcuts.ts` (the gate).
- `src/renderer/components/{AppInput,AppNumberField,AppTimecodeField}.tsx`
  (focus groups + Escape), `blurAfterMouseActivation.ts` (blur → region),
  `src/renderer/properties/PropertyPanel.tsx` (`onCancel` wiring).
- `src/renderer/timeline/subSelectionDelete.ts` and its three call sites in
  `LayerBlock.tsx`, `KeyframeLane.tsx`, `Timeline.tsx`.
- Gates: `src/renderer/focus/useFocusRegions.test.tsx` (release under a canceled
  pointerdown, focus-group exemption, Escape-before-commit ordering, chrome ⇒ no
  region), `src/renderer/timeline/subSelectionDelete.test.ts` (all three
  preemptors by contract), `src/renderer/shortcuts/useShortcuts.test.tsx` (the
  scope gate), `e2e/electron/focus-regions.spec.ts` (every open Panel is a
  region; a real click and a canceled `pointerdown` both release and commit —
  the two things jsdom cannot model).
