# Motifs

A Motif is a parameterized, time-varying overlay — a lower-third, a countdown, an
animated title card, a callout. The user picks one from the catalog, fills in its
props, and drops it on the timeline as a `Motif` layer; from then on it must
produce correct pixels at every composition frame, in both the live preview and
the export.

A Motif is **a real web page** — arbitrary HTML/CSS/SVG/canvas/WebGL and animation
libraries. There is exactly one rendering path, internally called **webcap**: the
page is driven to a precise time `t` and captured to a bitmap via the Chromium
DevTools Protocol (CDP), driven over `webContents.debugger` against an offscreen
Electron window. No per-engine backends, no engine-selection field.

This doc covers how a Motif instance becomes pixels. For the data model
(`MotifParams`, validation, the `add_motif` surface) see
[`data-model.md`](data-model.md); for the generic compositor see
[`render.md`](render.md).

## The principle, and the obstacle

The renderer's load-bearing principle is *preview pixels equal export pixels by
construction* — a single capture path feeds both surfaces. The hard platform wall
that shapes the design:

- **The export Worker has no DOM.** Preview runs in the renderer; export runs in a
  Web Worker against an `OffscreenCanvas` with no `document`/`<iframe>`/`Image`. It
  cannot run a Motif. So whatever produces preview pixels must produce export
  pixels through a path the Worker can consume — the **main process rasterizes,
  the Worker receives bitmaps**.

webcap clears it: capture happens on the main process, handing bitmaps to the
Worker for export. CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` is a real browser raster (not a
canvas read-back), so it sidesteps DOM-rasterization read-back hazards entirely —
the obvious "rasterize the DOM via an SVG `<foreignObject>`" route. (On Chromium an
inline `<foreignObject>` raster does not taint — measured, though external-resource
cases are unverified — so taint is not the binding reason. The Motif path uses CDP
capture regardless.)

The price of full web freedom is that a web page has its own clock and animates on
its own — nondeterministic, incompatible with a frame-exact editor (scrubbing,
re-export, preview==export all require that the same `t` always yields the same
pixels). The resolution is the **determinism contract**, the spine of the system:

> **A Motif renders as a pure function of time.** It never advances itself; the
> harness owns the clock and drives the page to each composition frame.

This is what makes Motifs a *video template system* rather than a screen recorder.
Everything else (capture, cache, export) is mechanism around this contract.

## Boundaries

- **In scope:** the authoring contract a Motif must satisfy, its parameter UI (the
  generated fallback form and a Motif's own `params.html`), the capture harness
  that turns it into bitmaps, the raster cache and its escalation levers, and how
  the compositor and export read Motif frames.
- **Out of scope:** adding/validating Motif layers ([`data-model.md`](data-model.md)),
  the generic per-frame composite ([`render.md`](render.md)), and audio/mux. A
  Motif carries no audio.

## Authoring contract

The author-facing contract — the `motif.define` lifecycle, the one law (state
is a function of `t`, never an accumulation), the manifest and its three
duration shapes, the `props_schema` variants, the fonts rule, and the sandbox
limits an author designs around — lives in
[`motif-authoring.md`](motif-authoring.md), the single normative spec. That
file is deliberately self-contained (it links to no other doc): the build ships
a verbatim copy of it inside the agent skill bundle, where no other repo
document is reachable.

Facts the rest of this document leans on:

- A built-in Motif is a directory of `manifest.json` + `index.html` (plus an
  optional `assets/` for fonts and images), embedded in the binary via
  `include_bytes!`; a user or agent Motif is a single self-contained HTML
  document carrying an injected manifest island. Either way it is served to
  the offscreen capture host over the `motif:` URI scheme.
- Props are validated against the manifest's `props_schema` (unknown keys
  reject, missing keys fall back to defaults) and canonicalized into a stable
  key order, so identical inputs produce identical bytes and identical cache
  keys.
- Content duration takes one of three manifest shapes — `max_duration_s` /
  `max_duration_prop` (caps the layer; windowable via `src_in_us`),
  `content_duration_s` (fixed content length, freely extendable layer whose
  tail holds the last content frame), or none (content = the placed layer
  width). The held tail is what lets the cache collapse a static overlay to a
  single capture, and a fixed content-frame count is why trimming never
  invalidates cached frames.
- `settle_rafs` (clamped to `{0,1,2}`, default `2`) is how many real browser
  frames the harness waits after a seek before capturing.

## Parameter UI

The property panel gets a Motif's controls one of two ways, and a single file on
disk decides which.

**The generated fallback form is the default.** With no parameter page, the host
builds the form from `props_schema`: one row per prop, switched on its type —
text input (a textarea when `multiline`), color swatch, number field with
steppers, dropdown for `enum` — one flat list in the manifest's own key order
(only the props *values* object is canonicalized alphabetically; the schema keeps
its authored order), labelled with the prop key title-cased (`bg_color` →
"Bg Color"). Those
labels are deliberately **not** localized: user- and agent-authored Motifs carry
arbitrary on-disk keys, so there is nothing the host could register in advance.
Each row commits one key per gesture (the color swatch debounced, because a drag
through the OS color dialog would otherwise flood the serialized capture queue).
The same generator serves the picker's props form, so the two surfaces cannot
drift.

**A `params.html` takes the surface over.** A Motif that ships one owns its whole
props section — labels, order, grouping, conditional rows, and whatever controls
the author can write — and the host stops generating anything for it. The schema
keeps every other job it had.

### Enablement is presence

A `params.html` next to `index.html` in the Motif's directory is the entire
switch. There is no manifest field, so a Motif's UI can change without touching
its data contract: the catalog payload carries `has_params_ui`, which the main
process derives by stat'ing the file (built-ins once at boot — their assets are
packaged read-only; user Motifs on every catalog listing, published copy first
then draft), and it never enters the manifest island, the content hash, or
manifest validation. Dropping the file in — or deleting it — switches the panel
on the next catalog refresh, which the Motif directory watcher already triggers
on any file change. Of the built-ins, `text-fx` ships a page; `countdown` and
`lower-third` deliberately stay on the fallback form.

### Where the page runs

The panel frames `motif://<id>/params.html?v=<catalog revision>` with
`sandbox="allow-scripts"` and **no** `allow-same-origin`. The `?v=` is the
runtime catalog's revision, which the watcher bumps on any Motif file change, so
editing the page on disk reloads the panel instead of serving a cached copy. Four
consequences an author designs around:

- **The origin is opaque.** `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `document.cookie`
  and `indexedDB` *throw* on access. `event.origin` on an inbound message reads
  `"null"`, so window identity is the only check worth making — which is exactly
  what the host side does.
- **There is no network.** The params CSP keeps `default-src 'none'` with no
  `connect-src`, so fetch/XHR/WebSocket/EventSource are denied, the same as for a
  render document. Assets are relative URLs (they resolve to `motif://<id>/…`) or
  `data:` URIs.
- **Companion files are allowed.** The params CSP differs from the render
  document's by exactly two sources: `script-src` and `style-src` additionally
  allow the `motif:` scheme, so a page may split into `.js`/`.css` files beside it
  rather than cramming everything inline. Inline script and style still work, so a
  single self-contained file is fine too. `'self'` appears in neither CSP — on an
  opaque origin it would match nothing.
- **The app frames nothing else.** The renderer's own CSP grants `frame-src
  motif:` and no `'self'`, so a Motif's parameter page is the only embeddable
  context in the app. Full CSP rationale: [`security.md`](security.md).

The frame is transparent and the page paints its own surfaces from the theme
tokens it receives, so it reads as part of the panel rather than as a foreign
form.

### The protocol

Five verbs over `postMessage`, all `motif:`-prefixed so a page can ignore the
unrelated traffic any embedder eventually produces.

| Verb | Direction | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `motif:init` | host → page | `{ motifId, layerId, props, schema, locale, themeTokens }` | once per loaded document, on the frame's `load` |
| `motif:propsChanged` | host → page | `{ props }` | the layer's props changed from *outside* this page (undo/redo, an agent edit, another surface) |
| `motif:preview` | page → host | `{ props }` (a patch) | mid-gesture |
| `motif:commit` | page → host | `{ props }` (a patch) | gesture end |
| `motif:resize` | page → host | `{ height }` (px) | whenever the page's content height changes |

`init.props` are the layer's committed props, leniently canonicalized, so a page
never has to reason about a stale stored value; `schema` is the manifest's
`props_schema` verbatim; `locale` is the app's active locale string; `themeTokens`
is a curated map of the app's CSS custom properties (surfaces, text, accent,
border, radius, font) — the page-facing subset, small on purpose so it can stay
stable.

**Nothing the page sends is believed.** The sender must be the frame's own
window, every payload is shape-checked before a field is read, keys the manifest
does not declare are dropped, and surviving values are lenient-canonicalized
against the current manifest — an invalid value degrades to its schema default.
Anything unrecognized is ignored silently. A page therefore cannot corrupt a
project, but a page that sends sloppy values watches them snap back, so send
well-formed ones (`#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`, numbers inside `min`/`max`, enum
options that exist).

### The gesture model

- **`preview` never touches project state.** The patch lands in a per-layer
  overlay that the render path merges at its canonicalization choke point, so it
  reaches both the rasterized frame and the frame cache key — and nothing else: no
  backend command, no history entry, nothing in the project file. Only the
  on-screen sprite reads it; the prewarmer, the disk baker, bake status and the
  export bake all describe committed props, so a live gesture can never write a
  transient frame to disk or move a bake progress bar.
- **Previews are throttled, so send freely.** The first patch of a gesture applies
  immediately and the rest coalesce into one update per 250 ms, matching the
  capture cost behind them (~80–100 ms per frame, serialized). Re-sending a value
  that has not changed costs no recapture.
- **`commit` is one history entry, however many keys it carries.** The whole patch
  rides a single `update_layer_params`, so coupled values (a preset landing three
  colors at once) are atomic and one undo takes all of them back. The overlay's
  committed keys are cleared only once the mutation settles — clearing eagerly
  would show the pre-commit frame for the length of the round-trip.
- **A page's own commit is not echoed back.** `propsChanged` fires for genuinely
  external changes only, so a page can repaint optimistically on its own edit
  without fighting a redundant update. An undo *does* arrive as `propsChanged`,
  which is what keeps a page's controls from showing stale values.
- **`resize` is advisory.** The host clamps the declared height to `[80, 1200]` px
  and sits at 240 until the page says otherwise, so a page can neither collapse to
  an invisible strip nor take the panel column hostage.
- **Teardown drops the gesture.** Selecting another layer, swapping the Motif, or a
  watcher-driven reload disposes the host: pending previews are discarded and the
  canvas returns to committed props rather than stranding on a half-finished drag.

### The reference page

`src/shared/motifs/builtin/text-fx/params.html` is the worked example and the
copy-paste template: a single self-contained document that groups its 13 props
into hand-ordered sections, switches its labels bilingually off `init.locale`
(the host never registers a Motif's strings — a page that cares about language
carries its own), skins itself from `themeTokens` with literal fallbacks for the
frame before the first message lands, shows rows only when they matter
(`type_speed` for the typewriter effect, `loop` for color-shift), composes an
RGB picker plus an alpha slider into `#rrggbbaa`, and offers preset swatches that
land three coupled colors in one commit.

## Determinism: owning the clock

Before any Motif code runs, the harness installs a clock takeover and seeks declared
animations to `t`:

| Animation source | How it is pinned to `t` |
|---|---|
| CSS animations/transitions, WAAPI | `document.getAnimations()` → `pause()` + `currentTime = tMs` |
| GSAP and other eased tweens | run on `requestAnimationFrame` + `performance.now` → both owned; the controlled rAF queue is flushed |
| canvas / WebGL render loops | bottom out on `requestAnimationFrame` → owned |
| `setTimeout` / `setInterval` / `Date.now` | stubbed to the virtual clock |

`seekTo(t)`: set the virtual clock; `getAnimations()` pause + `currentTime`; flush
the controlled rAF queue a bounded number of times (idempotent at a fixed clock);
force a layout flush; wait `settle_rafs` real browser frames so the paint commits;
then capture. The takeover is installed *before* any Motif code runs; an animation
that caches a `Date`/`performance` reference before that, or uses a time source the
harness does not hijack, is out of contract.

**The seek must stay re-seekable.** `seek()` only pauses and sets `currentTime` — it
never cancels or commits animations. Removing a completed animation would break
seeking *back* to an earlier time (the animation would be gone from
`getAnimations()`), violating the pure-function-of-`t` contract.

**Byte-identical determinism.** On Electron the offscreen-CDP capture is
**byte-identical across runs and across operating systems** at a fixed `t` — the
clock takeover freezes the frame, so two captures of the same Motif at the same `t`
produce the same bytes (verified across Windows, Linux, and macOS). Conformance
checks therefore assert exact-byte equality, not just a perceptual tolerance. The
cache captures each frame index once and reuses it.

## Capture harness

- **One reused offscreen Electron BrowserWindow host.** A single offscreen
  `BrowserWindow` (driven over `webContents.debugger` / CDP) is created lazily on first
  capture and reused across Motifs, frames, and layers. The footprint is one extra
  browser process tree, not one per layer.
- **Window-as-isolation.** The Motif is loaded as the host window's **top-level
  document**, served by the `motif:` scheme. Isolation comes from: a dedicated
  offscreen BrowserWindow (separate from the editor shell), no preload / disabled
  Node integration on the `motif:` origin, and a strict CSP (`default-src 'none'` plus
  only what capture needs) so the page is **fully offline** and can make no network
  request. The clock-takeover runtime is injected at document-start (before the
  Motif's `motif.define(...)`).
- **Multi-Motif navigation.** When a capture requests a different Motif than the one the
  host currently holds, the host **navigates** to the new `motif:` URL (reusing the
  window and CDP session; the init runtime is re-injected on the new document), and the
  capture state is reset so the readiness probe re-confirms the new page and the render
  metrics re-apply.
- **Capture via CDP, over `webContents.debugger`.** The host drives
  `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` (arbitrary resolution, independent of the physical
  screen), `Emulation.setDefaultBackgroundColorOverride` (alpha 0, so a Motif's
  `background: transparent` is preserved as real alpha instead of being flattened onto
  CDP's default opaque white), and `Page.captureScreenshot` (lossless **PNG** — the
  Canvas/CDP WebP path is lossy and crisp text edges matter). A `Runtime.evaluate`
  awaiting `window.__motifRender(t, props, meta)` runs `setup`/`frame`/seek/settle and
  resolves when the frame is visually ready; the screenshot follows. The whole
  render+capture is **serialized** under a lock so the several fill loops (on-demand
  sprite, prewarmer, baker) cannot interleave on the one host and screenshot a stale
  frame.

## Raster cache and escalation

A capture costs tens to ~100 ms — far more than a cheap vector raster — so the cost is
managed by **cache dedup, not a second renderer**: a static overlay produces identical
pixels every content frame, so the cache collapses it to one capture; only Motifs with
many *distinct* frames pay the per-frame cost repeatedly. Three escalation levers sit
over the one capture function:

- **L0 — on demand (default).** The playhead frame is captured when needed and bound as
  a texture, at the resolution the composite needs. An in-RAM LRU of per-frame bitmaps;
  evicted bitmaps are closed promptly.
- **L1 — in-RAM lookahead (always on).** A budget-paced background prewarmer fills the
  shared L0 cache ahead of the playhead, off the play loop, during playback and while
  paused. Active layers dedupe by content cache key (N identical Motifs warm one content
  set); a pure planner orders playhead-first, then forward, then earlier frames for small
  backward scrubs; the per-content budget keeps the warm set within the cache cap so the
  LRU can't evict a still-targeted frame.
- **L2 — persisted PNG.** One PNG per frame under `<workspace>/Cache/raster/`, keyed by a
  hash of `(motifId, version, contentHash, canonicalProps, renderW, renderH, fps, contentDurationFrames)`.
  Survives reload, caps the in-RAM working set, and lets export read frames off disk;
  safe to delete (regenerates). Driven by a global **Pre-bake** setting (off by default)
  and a per-layer **Pre-bake now** action; reads are disk-first, gated by an in-RAM
  baked-key index so un-baked Motifs pay no fs cost.

The key is **source-derived**: `contentHash` is a hash of the Motif's manifest + HTML, so
editing a Motif's source (or updating an installed one) yields a fresh key and re-captures —
the cache tracks *current* content rather than relying on a layer's stored version. A Motif
with no `contentHash` (a built-in seeded from the build-time bundle, whose content is fixed)
keys stably without it.

**Not in the cache key:** the layer transform and opacity (applied by the Pixi sprite at
composite time — moving/scaling/fading never re-captures) and the window position
(`src_in_us`; frames are keyed by absolute content-frame index, so trimming reuses cached
frames). Changing props, the content duration, or the composition fps does change the key.

### Editing an installed Motif

Editing an installed (or built-in) Motif opens a **working draft** seeded from its source —
a built-in is a forced **fork** (built-ins live in the bundle and can't be overwritten). The
selected layer swaps in place onto the draft so the source panel previews it. From there:

- **Update** republishes the draft over the original id and **bumps its version**. Because the
  cache key is source-derived, every placed layer — this project and others — re-renders with the
  new look. Current-project layers that referenced the working draft are **rebound** to the
  original id and their stored props are **lenient-migrated** to the new schema (unknown keys
  dropped, new keys filled from defaults) in one undo step; the source panel's render path already
  tolerates a mid-flight schema mismatch, so a placed layer never blanks. Other projects pick up
  the change the next time they open.
- **Save as new** publishes the draft under its own fresh id; the original is untouched.
- **Discard** swaps the layer back to the original and deletes the draft.

A Motif can also be **imported** from an external single-file `.html` (its manifest island is
parsed + validated at import; any id it claims is ignored and a fresh one minted). It lands as a
draft to preview and install — the same path an agent-authored Motif would take.

### Status display

Each Motif layer reports a bake phase — `idle | warming{progress} | rastering{progress} | ready | error`.
A **status dot** on the timeline layer block reflects it: warming shows L0 coverage filling
ahead of the playhead, a persisted (L2) sequence reads as ready immediately, error is
surfaced, idle shows nothing. The **property panel** adds a status line only while a bake is
in flight or failed — idle and ready earn no standing row there.

## Compositor integration

`compositeFrame(tUs)` passes each Motif sprite its layer-relative time
`tInLayerUs = tUsSnapped − layer.t_start_us`. The sprite resolves the content time, maps
it to a frame index on the exact-rational frame grid (shared `frames.ts` helpers — never
`round(µs·fps)`), clamps to `[0, contentDurationFrames − 1]`, obtains the frame (L0 / L1 /
L2), and binds the bitmap as its texture. Transform and opacity from the layer summary
apply to the sprite.

## Export

The export Worker has no DOM and cannot drive a renderer, so before the encode loop the
**main process** captures every Motif layer's frames — through the same host, at export
resolution, on the composition fps grid — and hands the bitmaps to the Worker
(transferred). This is surfaced through the export "preparing" wait. When a Motif is
already persisted at L2, the Worker reads its PNG files directly. Either way the bytes
come from the same capture path the preview used, so the exported Motif matches the
preview.

## User Motifs

Beyond the built-ins, users (and agents — see below) author their own Motifs. They're the
same single self-contained `.html` + manifest-island documents, stored globally under
`<app_config_dir>/motifs/` (so they're reusable across projects, like built-ins), and they
render through the exact same capture path — once installed, a user Motif behaves
indistinguishably from a built-in.

The lifecycle is **draft → preview → install**:

- **Create** — three entry points: the picker's **New** (a starter draft), **Import** of an
  external single-file `.html`, or an agent over MCP (`write_motif_draft`). A draft gets a
  unique, final-ready id at birth, so installing it needs no layer rebind.
- **Preview** — a draft is a placeable layer; the compositor renders it **into the real
  project canvas** so the author sees it in context. A draft's frames are keyed by
  `content_hash`, so every source edit re-captures (see [Raster cache](#raster-cache-and-escalation)).
- **Edit** — a placed draft layer gets an in-app **source panel** (edit the HTML + island,
  Apply → re-render). The on-disk store is also **watched**: saving a Motif's file from any
  external editor hot-reloads the same way — disk changes coalesce (debounced) into the same
  catalog resync the panel uses, and the content-hash cache key plus the capture-host
  cache-buster force a fresh capture. This covers installed Motifs too: any disk edit
  re-renders every placement. Editing an *installed* Motif opens a working draft (see
  [Editing an installed Motif](#editing-an-installed-motif)).
- **Install** — **publish-new** (under the draft's own id) or **update-in-place** (republish
  over the target, bump its version). Updates are **live/mutable**: every placement — this
  project and others — re-renders with the new look (the cache key is source-derived, never
  the layer's stored `motif_version`). **Save-as-new** is the "keep my old look" escape hatch.

Because updates are live/mutable, the `motif_version` stored on a placed layer is only a
**seen-at marker** — it never pins rendering. When a project opens, each Motif layer's marker
is compared against the catalog's current version; any mismatch surfaces a one-time
**"Motifs changed since you placed them"** notice (v1 → v3, with the affected layer count)
plus a status-log entry — the cross-project signal for updates made while this project was
closed. Dismissing it acknowledges: the markers bump to current in one undo step, so the
notice doesn't repeat on the next open. There is deliberately no global reverse index of
which projects use a Motif; each project self-reports when it opens.

A project referencing a since-deleted Motif degrades to an error placeholder, not a crash.
The lifecycle is driven from the property panel (Install / Edit / Update / Save-as-new /
Discard / Delete) with inline confirms, and equivalently over the MCP tools below. Security
of the untrusted-document case is covered in [Security](#security).

## Agent surface

An MCP agent can both *place* and *author* Motifs, mirroring the human lifecycle through the
same backend cores (so the two surfaces can't drift):

- **Place / inspect.** `add_motif_layer` is props-only — agents reason about *what* a Motif says,
  never about capture or timing — and resolves built-ins **and** user Motifs (drafts +
  installed). `list_motifs` enumerates the full catalog (each entry carries `status` =
  `builtin | installed | draft`, plus `content_hash`/`target_id`), and `motifs://current`
  mirrors it. Raster state is read-only (`idle | warming | rastering | ready | error`); the
  export "preparing" wait blocks on pending bakes. (The MCP list is manifest-only — `html` is
  stripped so it doesn't bloat agent context; agents fetch source on demand.)
- **Author.** `get_motif_source {id}` reads a Motif's `{ manifest, html }`; `write_motif_draft
  { manifest, html, from? }` writes a draft (`from` records an existing Motif as the Update
  target); `preview_motif_draft { id, t_sec, width?, height?, props? }` returns a base64 PNG of
  one frame so the agent can **see its output and self-correct**; `install_motif { draft_id, mode:
  new | update }` publishes (update bumps the version + rebinds + migrates placed layers);
  `delete_motif { id }` removes a user Motif (built-ins rejected).

Agents observe and author; they never drive the renderer directly.

## Security

User Motifs are untrusted web documents (an agent or a human authored them), so the
capture host is the trust boundary. A **single reused offscreen Electron
BrowserWindow** (driven over `webContents.debugger` / CDP) navigates between Motif
ids/content hashes; isolation comes from a dedicated window (separate from the
editor), no preload / disabled Node integration on the `motif:` origin, and CSP
`default-src 'none'` — fully offline (no `connect-src` → no fetch/XHR/WebSocket).
That window-as-sandbox carries both trusted built-ins and untrusted user Motifs. On
top of it:

- **Import-time validation** — the manifest island is parsed + validated against the
  `Manifest`/`PropSpec` schema (sane `size` bounds, well-formed `props_schema`,
  `default_duration_s`/`content_duration_s` finite-and-positive) and rejected at write/import,
  not as a runtime crash.
- **Per-frame wall-clock timeout** — `motif_capture_frame` caps the render so an
  infinite-loop Motif fails the frame (and tears down the wedged host) instead of hanging.
- **Path-safe disk serving** — the `motif:` scheme resolver rejects `..`/absolute/separator
  escapes and confirms the resolved path stays under the Motif's own directory.
- **Id-namespace isolation** — minted ids can never shadow a built-in (`countdown`,
  `lower-third`) or the reserved `drafts/` segment; the manifest's own `id`/`version` are
  ignored (app-assigned).
- **The parameter page is sandboxed separately** — a Motif's `params.html` runs
  *inside* the editor window, so it gets its own boundary: an `allow-scripts` iframe
  with no `allow-same-origin` (an opaque origin, no reach into the app's DOM), the
  offline params CSP, and a host seam that authenticates by window identity and
  validates every payload against the manifest before it can touch a layer. See
  [Parameter UI](#parameter-ui) and [`security.md`](security.md).

Residual accepted risk: a renderer-level Chromium exploit is out of our control (mitigated by
the isolated, offline host with no preload / Node integration); a determinism-violating Motif
renders wrong but harmlessly (surfaced by the determinism story).
