# Driving WeftCut

WeftCut is a desktop video editor; you operate it over MCP while the user
watches the same project live in the app. Every mutation you commit lands in
their undo history and on their screen. Each tool's own description carries its
full contract — this skill covers only what no single tool can: how a session
should go.

## Session etiquette

1. Read `project://current` before your first mutation — never write against a
   guessed state.
2. Call `checkpoint` before your first edit, so the user has a one-step
   restore point.
3. A small change (a handful of tool calls) needs no more ceremony than that:
   edit, verify, report.
4. A batch job (rough-cutting a video, a silence pass, building a caption
   track) is different: ASK the user whether to switch the app into agent mode,
   and call `begin_agent_session` only after they agree. Wrap the batch in
   `lock_history` … `unlock_history`, and rehearse it with `dry_run` first
   where its op set allows.
5. Errors are instructions: WeftCut errors name the cause and list concrete
   options. Pick one; never retry a rejected call verbatim.
6. A commit can also fail because the user (or another agent) edited
   concurrently — re-read the resource and reapply.
7. Export is deliberately not a tool. When the user wants a rendered file,
   point them to the app's Export UI.

## Working rhythm

Read → analyze → mutate → **verify**: after mutating, re-read what you changed
(`project://tracks`, `project://current`) and confirm the edit landed as
intended before reporting it done.

Common flows, one line each — parameters and caveats live in the tool
descriptions:

- Mark silences: `detect_silences` → an anchored region `add_marker` per gap
  (also packaged as the `/cut-silences` prompt). It marks rather than cuts —
  deleting a silent slice leaves an equally long gap, so removing dead air
  waits on a ripple primitive.
- Captions: `transcribe_clip` → inspect the returned SRT → `apply_subtitles`
  (also `/auto-caption`).
- Voiceover: `synthesize_speech` appends a spoken script to the timeline
  (also `/voiceover`).
- Rough cut: `analyze_clip` or `auto_split_by_shot`, then trim and delete
  segments.

## Motifs (animated overlays)

To author or update a Motif, first read `motif-authoring.md` next to this file
— the document contract, whose one law is that visible state is a function of
`t`, never an accumulation. Then:

1. `list_motifs`, and read the closest existing Motif with `get_motif_source`
   — base your draft on what already renders correctly.
2. `write_motif_draft` (pass `from` when your draft updates an existing Motif).
3. **The user approves, not you.** Place the draft with `add_motif`, ask the
   user to play it in the app, and call `install_motif` only after they
   confirm. If you can read images, pre-check with `preview_motif_draft` at
   three timestamps (start, middle, near the end) and once with non-default
   props before involving the user — their confirmation is still the gate.
4. After installing, remove the trial layer unless the user wants it kept.
