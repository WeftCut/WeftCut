//! Per-source software-decode session thread + registry.
//!
//! A strict simplification of `preview_gpu/session.rs`. Each preview session owns
//! a dedicated OS thread that opens a [`SwVideoStream`] and runs a
//! DECODE-ON-REQUEST loop: napi-side commands (`request_frame_at` / `close`) post
//! messages over an mpsc channel; decoded frames leave the thread as owned
//! [`SwFramePoke::Frame`] bytes (NV12, or tightly-packed I420P10 for a 10-bit
//! session — the frame's `format` says which) through a shared sink.
//!
//! What this DROPS vs. the GPU mirror (and why): there is no D3D11 anywhere — no
//! shared-texture pool, no keyed mutex, no slot free-list, no `ConsumeAck`
//! round-trip, and none of the decode-bench timing probes. The GPU path needs all
//! of that because a decoded surface is a *borrowed* GPU texture valid only until
//! the next `next_frame`, so the renderer must ack before the slot is reused. Here
//! the frame bytes ARE the payload: [`SwFrame`] is fully owned and `Send`, so it
//! travels through the sink and outlives the stream — no coherence protocol
//! needed, and no background refill pump.
//!
//! Requests are served forward-continuing (a seek only when the target moves
//! backward or lands too far ahead) and coalesced latest-wins at the loop top —
//! see [`serve_request`], [`PumpCursor`] and the drain in [`session_thread`].
//!
//! Thread ownership: [`SwVideoStream`] is `!Send`-in-spirit (raw ffmpeg
//! pointers; marked `Send` forward-compat) but it is created, driven, and
//! dropped entirely on the session thread and never crosses a boundary, so
//! that mark is never exercised here. Only plain `Send` data crosses: the
//! command `Receiver`, the sink `Arc`, the path/id strings in, and the
//! pokes out.
//!
//! The napi addon wires the registry + sink; from the plain-lib build's
//! view the public API is `dead_code` (the unit test exercises it).
