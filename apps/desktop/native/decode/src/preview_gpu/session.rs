//! Per-session decode thread + shared RGBA8 texture pool + registry.
//!
//! Each preview session owns a dedicated OS thread pinned to its `!Send`
//! D3D11 + ffmpeg objects: the thread opens the `VideoStream`, builds a pool of
//! shared RGBA8 textures on ffmpeg's own D3D11 device (the NV12→RGBA convert
//! target), and runs an anchor-driven decode loop. napi commands
//! (`request_frame_at` / `consume_ack` / `close`) post messages to the thread
//! over an mpsc channel; decoded frames are announced back out through a poke
//! sink (`FrameReady` / `Eof` / `Error`).
//!
//! Why a thread per session: the D3D11/ffmpeg COM objects are `!Send`, so each
//! session owns its thread and only plain `Send` data crosses the boundary (see
//! `OpenInfo`).
//!
//! Slot coherence: a slot is overwritten only after its `consume_ack` marked it
//! free. That ack — invoked explicitly by the preload once the snapshot's
//! cross-device read has GPU-completed, *not* the keyed mutex across the async
//! `createImageBitmap` boundary — is the coherence guarantee. With
//! `pool_size >= 2` the producer fills slot B while the renderer still snapshots
//! slot A. The keyed mutex only serialises our GPU write against Chromium's GPU
//! read of the same texture.
