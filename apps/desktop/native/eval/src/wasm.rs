//! Resident-ABI wasm exports. SCALARS ONLY across the boundary: the active
//! keyframe track lives in static buffers, uploaded once via `set_kf`/`set_n`
//! and evaluated per call by `eval`. Times are `f64` µs and rates are `i32`
//! (NEVER i64 — that would force BigInt marshaling at the JS boundary). Built
//! only for wasm32; the native crate excludes this module.
//!
//! Color is the one carve-out: an `Rgba8` crosses as a PACKED i32 (RGBA8 in one
//! scalar) via `set_kf_rgba`/`eval_rgba_packed` — still no BigInt and no memory
//! reads, just one i32 per color instead of four channel scalars.
//!
//! Single-threaded by construction (one wasm instance, no threads), so the
//! `static mut` track buffer needs no synchronization. `Rational` is NOT here —
//! the snap fn takes `(num, den)` primitives (it stays in the napi crate).
// NOTE: the generic `crate::eval` is NOT imported here — this module exports its
// own `extern "C" fn eval` (the scalar shim), so the color path calls
// `crate::eval::<Rgba8>` fully-qualified to dodge the name collision.
