//! `SceneDescriber` capability surface — a set of timed frames in, a
//! format-tagged [`RawDescription`] out.
//!
//! Twin of [`speech::transcriber`](crate::speech): the trait is deliberately
//! thin (a backend produces one raw output style, it does NOT normalize —
//! normalization is [`super::parser`]) and `Send + Sync + dyn`-compatible so the
//! resolver hands back a `Box<dyn SceneDescriber>` regardless of backend.
//!
//! **Input contract = a set of timed frames, not a video file.** The tool layer
//! samples frames from the source at `fps`, attaches each frame's window-relative
//! timestamp, and hands the same [`TimedFrame`] list to every backend (local
//! sidecar, BYO endpoint, cloud) — the per-backend adapter presents them the way
//! that engine expects. Keeping timestamps window-relative (0-based) here mirrors
//! how [`speech`](crate::speech) parsers emit slice-relative times and the tool
//! shifts onto the timeline; here the tool shifts onto source-absolute time.
