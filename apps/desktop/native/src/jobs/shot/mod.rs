//! design — always on, zero new deps. Surfaced as the `analyze_clip` MCP tool
//! (docs/mcp.md).
//!
//! Owns: cut detection behind the [`ShotDetector`] seam (ffmpeg today; a learned
//! detector like TransNetV2 can swap in behind the same trait), shot assembly,
//! brightness / motion / sharpness + black / freeze / fade flags, and the VSHOT
//! write-through cache
//! ([`cached_source_report`]) shared by the `analyze_clip` tool and the
//! `media://{id}/analysis` resource. The cache stores ONE whole-source report
//! per (source, params); callers clip it to a layer window with [`clip_report`].
//!
//! Also owns the scan / reduce split: [`floor_opts`] is the single cached
//! whole-source pass at [`FLOOR_SENSITIVITY`], [`reduce`] re-derives the shot
//! list from it at any higher threshold with no I/O, and [`is_report_cached`] is
//! the read-only probe for whether that pass has already run. What it does NOT
