//! `LogBus` — owns the in-memory ring, broadcast channel, and a sender
//! to the JSONL writer task. Built by `LogBus::spawn(...)` when a
//! workspace is opened; rotated when the workspace switches.
//!
//! See `docs/status-log.md` for the full design.
//!
//! Pre-workspace policy (strict): the slot is `None` until
//! `project_save_as` / `project_open` / `project_new_workspace`
//! installs a bus. Producers must check `slot.current()` before
//! emitting — `emit` is otherwise a no-op (silent drop on the caller
//! side via the `if let Some(bus)` pattern).
//!
//! Concurrency notes:
//!   * `emit` is non-blocking. It pushes to a parking_lot RwLock-guarded
//!     ring (microseconds), then `broadcast::Sender::send` (non-blocking,
//!     drops if no subscribers) and `mpsc::Sender::try_send` (drops the
//!     JSONL line on full, silently — see `WRITER_CAPACITY`).
//!   * Never call `tracing::*!` macros inside `emit` — see
//!     [[feedback_async_block_on_in_async]] for the analogous trap.
//!     `tracing_layer` forwards `tracing::error!` events into `emit`,
//!     so re-emitting tracing events inside `emit` would recurse.
