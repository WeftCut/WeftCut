// Under `test-noop` (see `[features]` in Cargo.toml) `napi-derive/noop` deletes
// every `#[napi]` wrapper, so everything reachable only through the addon
// surface reads as dead. That cascade is a property of the test link mode, not
// of the code, and it buries any real warning — so `dead_code` is allowed for
// that feature only; the production build keeps the lint live. Item-level
// `#[expect(dead_code)]` sites opt out of the same feature for the same reason:
// rustc reports only the outermost dead item, so a field's expectation goes
// unfulfilled once its parent is dead.
