//! The app's single owner of the ffmpeg / ffprobe binary path, plus the
//! sidecar bootstrap that makes sure one exists.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS INSTEAD OF `ffmpeg_sidecar::paths::ffmpeg_path()`
//! (issue #7 boundary #7): that resolver prefers a binary sitting **adjacent
//! to the running executable** over anything on PATH. Electron main puts the
//! version-pinned build on PATH (`main/index.ts`), so an unrelated `ffmpeg`
//! left next to the Electron binary — a stale `auto_download` from an older
//! checkout is the observed source — silently outranks it for every spawn.
//! The failure is invisible by construction: the shadow is a real ffmpeg, so
//! nothing errors; it just has different encoders. On this repo's Linux host
//! it demoted every export to `libx264`/`libx265` because the johnvansickle
//! build carries no NVENC, and on macOS it masked a VideoToolbox probe
//! failure. Both incidents were diagnosed only from the status log.
//!
//! So the preference is INVERTED here: a PATH hit (the controlled build) wins,
//! and an exe-adjacent binary is REFUSED with a loud warning naming both
//! paths. The adjacent binary is still used when nothing else is reachable —
//! that is exactly where `auto_download` puts its download on Windows/macOS,
//! and refusing it there would break the clean-machine fallback.
//!
//! Every ffmpeg/ffprobe spawn in this crate resolves through `ffmpeg_path()` /
//! `ffprobe_path()` here. Importing the sidecar crate's versions re-opens the
//! hole.
