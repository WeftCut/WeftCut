// Centring a layer in the frame, as pure geometry: a layer's transform frame at
// an instant, and the `x`/`y` shift that puts its visible box in the middle of
// the composition. No renderer, no store, no IPC — the commands in
// `commands/appCommands.ts` supply the layer, the probe's natural size and the
// commit.
//
// `TransformGizmo.tsx` reads `TRANSFORMABLE_KINDS`, `transformOriginFor` and
// `layerFrameAt` from here rather than keeping its own copies, so the rectangle
// the gizmo draws a box around and the rectangle "Center horizontally" centres
// are the same rectangle by construction. Anything else that needs a layer's
// footprint belongs here too. LANDMINE: a second private copy of this geometry
// is not a duplicate the compiler will catch — nothing enforces the agreement,
// and a drift looks broken on neither side alone (the gizmo boxes one rectangle
// while "Center horizontally" centres another).
