// On-canvas transform box for the primary selected layer: shows its footprint
// over the preview, drags it to a new position, resizes it by the handles on its
// corners and edges, rotates it by the knob on a stalk above its top edge, and
// moves its anchor by the target reticle at the pivot.
//
// One kind resizes differently: on a Text layer the eight handles write the
// layout BOX (`box_w`/`box_h`) rather than `scale`, because a box lays glyphs out
// while `scale` magnifies an already-rasterized atlas (ADR 0049). That branch
// runs through the same solve, and the differences it does have — plain params
// scalars instead of tracks, no position compensation, an override channel that
// is absolute rather than additive, a double-click that steps back toward auto —
// are each commented where they land.
//
// Screen-space by design — an SVG overlay, not Pixi children. The stage is
// read back by the eyedropper and by the conformance capture hooks, so anything
// drawn into it would poison those buffers; and a box drawn in composition
// space would be sub-pixel on a 4K composition shown in a small panel.
//
// All pointer- and frame-rate updates here are imperative through refs.
