// The menu bar's structure book: which commands appear in which dropdown, in
// what order, with which separators. Everything else about an item — label,
// handler, enabled/checked state, shortcut hint — is looked up in the command
// registry at render time (`CommandMenu.tsx`), so this file and `ACTION_DEFS`
// cannot drift: adding a menu command means one entry in the registry's
// catalog and one id here.
//
// Structure stays a static tree rather than placement metadata on each
// CommandDef because menu order is an editorial decision, not command state —
// the same judgement `shared/menu.ts` makes when it gives main the native
// menu's structure but not its labels.
//
// Ids are type-locked to the union of catalogued actions and menu-only
// commands; a typo or a removed command fails `tsc`, not the user.
