// DOM-level focus-region primitives: which region a node belongs to, which
// composite field it belongs to, and whether a press on it moves focus by
// itself. No React and no store, so the shortcuts dispatcher, the field
// widgets, and the region hook can all import this without a cycle.
//
// A focus REGION is a dock panel. `PANEL_REGISTRY` already enumerates every
// kind and `WeftCutPanelRenderer` already wraps every panel's content in one
// element, so regions need no taxonomy of their own — see ADR 0041.
//
// LANDMINE: this module must NOT import `panelRegistry`. It is imported by the
// shared field widgets (`AppInput`, `AppNumberField`, `AppTimecodeField`), and
// `panelRegistry` pulls in `../i18n` — which turned every widget into an i18n
// consumer and broke suites that partially mock `react-i18next`. Region
// strings leave here raw; `useFocusRegions` narrows them to `PanelKind`.

/// Marks a focus-region root. Its value is the `PanelKind` and nothing else:
/// `ActionDef.scope` is a list of kinds, so a region name that carried an
/// instance too would be read as a kind the catalogue does not have.

/// input: a NumberField's stepper pair, a clearable input's ✕, the sibling

/// `AppInput` deliberately keeps focus for would blur (and commit) the field,
