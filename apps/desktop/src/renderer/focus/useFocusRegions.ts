// The focus-region driver: three window listeners that keep DOM focus, and
// therefore `activeRegion`, honest. Mounted ONCE, at the renderer root.
//
// NLE convention: a press anywhere outside the focused text editor releases
// it, and focus always lands on a real region rather than on `<body>`. Both
// halves matter. Every field in the app commits on blur, so "release" also
// means "commit" — clicking a gizmo handle mid-edit applies the typed value
// instead of leaving it parked and invisible. And landing focus on a region
// rather than nowhere is what lets a bare-key shortcut be scoped at all
// (`ActionDef.scope`) instead of fighting a parked control with
// `captureGlobal`.
