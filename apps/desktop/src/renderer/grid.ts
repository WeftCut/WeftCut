///
/// THE KEY FACT, and the reason this is not a second grid: a 48 kHz sample boundary
/// IS a frame boundary at rate 48000/1.
///   timeUsAtFrame(i, 48000, 1)  === round(i * 1e6 / 48000)   ← the sample time
///   frameIndexRound(us, 48000, 1) === usToFrame(us, 48000)   ← the mixer's index
/// (that second identity reduces to `(us*48000 + 500000)/1000000` on both sides —
/// asserted in `main/state/snap.test.ts`.) So `domain` NAMES the lattice for
/// diagnostics and messaging; it does not select a different algorithm. There is one
/// i128 leaf implementation, which is what makes "zero rounding at the render seam"
/// true rather than aspirational: the authoring index and the mixer's sample index
/// are the same integer.
///
/// Lives in the renderer tree, beside `frames.ts`, because BOTH sides need it: the
/// actor re-exports it through `main/state/snap.ts` (the same direction main already
/// takes for the eval leaf), and the timeline UI imports it directly for nudges and
/// readouts. A copy on each side would be exactly the drift this file prevents.

 *    number of microseconds — 1 µs at 60 fps, on roughly 30 % of landings.
 *  - Each member snaps on ITS OWN lattice (`gridForLayerKind`), never the anchor's.
 *    That is what carries a deliberately slipped A/V sync offset through a
 *    whole-link move intact (R2-D7): the offset is stored as geometry and nothing
 *    else, so it survives exactly as long as every member keeps landing on the
 *    lattice it was authored on.
 *
 *  Pure, and deliberately free of policy: the zero boundary is `floorShiftAtZero`

 *  the picture it was placed against is not a repair). */
