/// The one name a layer is shown under, anywhere it is named: its own label,

/// actually renders, else its translated kind.
///
/// The Text rung is there because `kinds.text` is the one kind name that adds
/// nothing: every surface that shows it also shows a Type glyph beside it, and
/// nothing in the app ever WRITES a Text layer's label (`applyAddLayer` stores
/// `label: null`, and an .srt import runs it per cue), so without this rung a
/// hundred imported captions all read "Text". The search palette already names
/// captions by content — search/buildEntries.ts takes the same view from the
/// other end — so this makes the timeline agree with the palette rather than
/// inventing a rule.
///
/// A blank label counts as absent — clearing the inline-rename field must leave
/// a clip named after its media, not nameless. Blank CONTENT is absent for the
/// same reason, so an empty Text layer still reaches its kind rather than
/// rendering a zero-width name. A uuid is NEVER a name: it tells the user
/// nothing and displaces the text that would. Call this instead of
/// `layer.label ?? layer.id`.
///
/// `t` is structurally typed rather than `TFunction` so callers can pass
/// `useTranslation().t` straight through (same pattern as peek.ts's
/// `formatPeekDelta`).
