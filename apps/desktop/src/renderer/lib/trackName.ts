/// The one name a track is shown under, anywhere it is named: its own label,

/// An absent label means the name is DERIVED (ADR 0042), and a blank one counts
/// as absent exactly as it does for layers — so a lane is never nameless.
/// Deriving here rather than in main is what makes the reserved lanes
/// translatable at all: main holds no locale bundle, so a name computed there
/// would ship one language into every UI.

/// `tracks` is the project's track vector in DATA order (index 0 = bottom of the
/// z-stack), never the timeline's reversed-and-filtered row order: the number is
/// the track's 1-based position from the bottom, so a rendered row list would
/// renumber every lane the moment the A/B Roll filter hides one. It renumbers when
/// lanes are added or pruned, which is what Premiere and Resolve do too.
///
/// `t` is structurally typed rather than `TFunction` so callers can pass
/// `useTranslation().t` straight through (same pattern as `layerDisplayName`).
