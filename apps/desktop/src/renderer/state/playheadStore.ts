// Global playhead-time store: ONE moment, held in ROOT time.
//
// Root time, and every consumer has to say which side of that it is on. A
// timeline Panel showing a Group reads its own projection of this number
// (`playheadProjection.ts`), and a scrub in that Panel projects back up into
// it — there is no second playhead (ADR 0053 decision 2). Taking the value here
// for a local time is the failure this store invites, and it is silent: at the
// root the two agree exactly, so the bug only appears once someone opens a
// Group. Anything that means "where this composition is" goes through
// `playheadProjection.ts`; anything that means "where the film is" reads here.
//
// The PlaybackEngine emits a time update once per
// COMPOSITION FRAME during playback (PlaybackEngine.emitTime → onTimeUpdate).
// Holding that value in React state at the App root re-rendered the entire
// tree 30–60×/s while playing — a pure CPU tax in production, and in dev the
// React-development-build commit overhead additionally ratchets renderer
// memory ~75–80 MB per played minute (native-side, GC-immune; see
// docs/render.md §Playhead updates). This store is the fan-out point instead;
// NOTHING at frame rate may live in React state above a leaf.
//
// Consumption rules (pick the cheapest tier that fits):
//   1. Event handlers (shortcuts, insert-at-playhead, snap-at-event-time):
//      read `playheadTimeUs()` imperatively at event time. Never subscribe.
//   2. Smooth per-frame visuals (timeline playhead line, timecode readout):
//      TRANSIENT subscription — `usePlayheadStore.subscribe` in an effect,
//      mutate the DOM node via ref. Zero React commits.
//   3. Panels showing "value at playhead" (inspector, Playhead Panel):
//      `usePlayheadTimeUsThrottled()` — trailing-edge throttle, converges on
//      the final value after the last change (pause/seek lands exactly).
//   4. Tiny leaf components where per-frame React commits are acceptable
//      (agent-mode MiniTimeline): `usePlayheadTimeUs()`.
//
// N timelines can stand open at once, so every subscriber here is multiplied by
// the number of Panels. A projection on a per-frame path hoists its anchor
// frame once (`useAnchorFrame`) rather than walking the summary per emit.
