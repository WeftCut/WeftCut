// Transient, NON-recorded transform deltas for an in-flight on-canvas drag.
// Same idiom as `effects/effectOverrides.ts`: the Compositor consults this
// AFTER resolveView (which rewrites x/y from the tracks every composite, so
// writing sprite positions directly would be clobbered on the next frame).
// Never enters React state or undo — the gesture commits once on release.
//
// Why a DELTA and not an absolute position: a keyframed layer must keep
// animating while it is being dragged, so the offset has to compose with
// whatever the tracks resolve to at the current playhead. The Text box pair is
// the one exception, and `boxW` names why the rule does not reach it.
//
// Realm note: the export Worker builds its own Compositor in its own realm, so
// this map is always empty there — both `with…Override` functions are the
// identity for export by construction, no mode check needed.
// Spec: docs/features.md#on-canvas-transform-gizmo
