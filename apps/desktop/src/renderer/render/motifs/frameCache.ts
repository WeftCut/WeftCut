// Per-frame raster cache for animated motifs.
//
// A motif animates over its duration: each composition frame is a distinct
// CDP capture decoded to an `ImageBitmap`. This cache holds a SEQUENCE of
// frames per motif instance, keyed by `(cacheKey, frameIndex)` — distinct
// from a single-bitmap-per-motif cache.
//
// Two layers:
//
//   L0 (default, must-have) — an in-RAM, bounded LRU of per-frame
//   `ImageBitmap`s. This is what preview pulls on-demand while
//   scrubbing. Evicted bitmaps are `.close()`d so their GPU-side
//   backing is freed promptly rather than waiting on GC — except one a
//   sprite still has bound (`retain`), which closes on its last `release`.
//
//   L2 (opt-in, lighter) — a PNG frame sequence persisted to disk
//   under `<workspace>/Cache/raster/<hash>/<i>.png`. Driven by a global
//   "Pre-bake" setting and a per-layer "Pre-bake now" action; read on the
//   default preview path via `resolveMotifFrame` (disk-first, gated by
//   an in-RAM baked-key index). The `MotifBaker` is the sole writer.
//
// `cacheKey` is an opaque STRING the caller builds from
// `(motifId, version, canonicalPropsJSON, renderW, renderH,
// fpsNum, fpsDen, durationFrames)`. The cache never parses it; it only
// hashes it (for the L2 dir name) and uses it as the L0 key prefix.

/// Minimal contract the L0 store needs from a cached frame. The browser
/// `ImageBitmap` satisfies this; a vitest can pass `{ close: vi.fn() }`.
/// Typing the store this way is what makes the LRU / recency / eviction
/// logic unit-testable in Node, where `ImageBitmap` doesn't exist.
