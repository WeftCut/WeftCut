// an explicit `pool.release`. Both of the Compositor's clip-teardown sites must
// call it: otherwise the pool holds the handle until its idle sweep notices
// seconds later, and a clip resolving inside that window races admission
// against layers the user already deleted — a permanent loss, since the lane is
// picked once per source. These tests pin the release, not the teardown.
