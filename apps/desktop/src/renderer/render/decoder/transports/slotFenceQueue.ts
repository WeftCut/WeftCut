// Deferred slot acks for the hardware preview lane, taken on the renderer's own
// PRESENTED graphics device.
//
// Why this exists at all: the native decode thread overwrites a shared-texture
// slot in place as soon as it is acked, so the ack must not fire until
// Chromium's cross-device read of that slot has GPU-COMPLETED (the race, and why
// `await createImageBitmap` is not that guarantee, is documented once at the
// barrier block in src/preload/index.ts). The preload can express that wait
// itself — mode `fence` — but only on a private offscreen WebGL2 context, which
// offers no blocking wait (`MAX_CLIENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_WEBGL` is 0 on Chromium):
// on an IDLE GPU the fence does not signal on its own at all, so the drain's
// flush-and-poll SPIN is what completes it, ~20ms of renderer thread a time, and
// a single quiet track spends ~2s per 20s window doing it.
//
// What this queue changes is that there is nothing to spin in. The completion
// signal on the renderer's WebGPU device is a PROMISE, so a slot that is not
// ready yet costs nothing on the renderer thread to keep waiting for. It is NOT
// that the signal arrives sooner: it arrives around 90ms. That hold can limit
// decode throughput with a shallow native pool, but completion is the ownership
// boundary — elapsed wall time is not evidence that native may safely overwrite
// the shared texture.
//
// So under `rendererFence` the preload runs NO barrier and delivers the bitmap
// with the ack obligation attached; this queue discharges it.
//
// INVARIANT — every live submitted bitmap acks EXACTLY ONCE, and only after its
// probe signals. `submit` either queues the ack or performs a completed fallback
// before returning; nothing else may ack. The ack is deliberately independent
// of PAINT: a frame the ring evicts, or one that arrives while the compositor is
// suspended, still holds a slot and still acks. The one exception is a stream
// tearing down (`dropFor`), where the slots cease to exist with the native
// session and acking into it is the thing to avoid.
//
// TWIN: the preload's `fence` queue (src/preload/index.ts) protects the same
// ownership boundary in another realm. Its WebGL sync requires polling; this
// WebGPU path is callback-driven. A change to either completion contract wants
// a look at the other.
