// Rolling window over the per-frame handoff timings for the hardware lane: the
// preload stamps every frame message with `gvfMs` / `cibMs` / `residentMs`, and
// this window summarizes them.
//
// "Handoff" spans both sides of the port: under the shipped barrier the preload
// runs none and the renderer takes the completion signal itself, so
// `GpuTransport` records ITS OWN barrier stamps and fence health for those
// frames. The fields mean the same thing either way — what ran, what it cost,
// what it deferred — which is what lets one window compare the two.
//
// The number this exists for is `barrier`: the read-completion cost stamped
// directly around whichever barrier ran before the slot is acked (the
// subtraction in `record` is only a legacy fallback). A barrier is load-bearing
// for cross-device read ordering — without one the lane presents frames
// pool_size out of order — but it blocks a thread once per frame PER SESSION, so
// with several hardware clips it is the prime suspect for presentation judder
// that `lag`/dropped-frame counters cannot see.
//
// Pure and allocation-light: a fixed ring, sorted only when a summary is asked
// for (the HUD polls at 2 Hz).
