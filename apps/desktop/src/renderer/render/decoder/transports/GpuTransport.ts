// Native-GPU `DecodeTransport` — the MessagePort + shared-texture path (see
// docs/decode-bench.md for the full transport recap):
// `window.api.previewGpu.{open,requestFrameAt,close,requestPort}` are the only
// IPC-shaped calls; they carry session commands,
// never frame bytes. Decoded frames (and eof/error pokes) arrive on a
// `MessagePort` the PRELOAD hands to this main-world context via
// `window.postMessage` in response to `requestPort()` — a port can't cross
// `contextBridge` itself. The `message` listener MUST be attached before
// calling `requestPort()`, or the one-time handoff can be missed.
//
// This is the transport half only — no FrameRing, no first-frame/fatal-error
// hooks, no idle bookkeeping. Those stay with `FfmpegSource` (the caller),
// which owns exactly one `DecodeTransport` at a time.
