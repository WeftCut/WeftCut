// indicator (and, later, res-throttle / stop-on-drop).

// waits for decode (industry-standard NLE transport; docs/render.md).
// When the decoder falls behind, the painter deliberately holds its
// previous frame (`ActiveClip.boundFramePtsUs`), so without this module
// the only trace of an underrun is a console log.

// separately because they point at different fixes. `UnderrunSnapshot`'s
// two count fields define what each one scores.
//
// Both drive one edge-triggered "active" flag safe to write straight
// into React state. This module owns neither the loop nor the ring:
// `Compositor` hands it the frame-selection verdict once per composite
// sweep, and the tick interval falls out of that same call's clock read.
