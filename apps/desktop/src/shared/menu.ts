// Contract for the macOS native application menu: what the renderer pushes to
// main so the native items and the in-app `AppMenuBar` cannot drift.
//
// The split — main owns the menu's structure, the renderer owns every label and
// accelerator in it. Why that direction: labels are i18n keys only i18next can
// resolve (the user switches locale in-app; main has no i18next), and the
// effective binding is catalogue defaults ⊕ `keybindings.json` overrides, which
// the renderer already resolves for its own menu hints. One resolver, both
// surfaces. Which items exist and where: src/main/appMenu.ts. Why the two
// surfaces divide the way they do: ADR 0031.
//
// Types + plain data only: main, preload and the renderer all import this, so
// it must stay free of DOM and Electron types.

/// Action ids the native menu may project. A subset of the renderer's
/// `ActionId` union, named here so main can reference actions without importing
/// renderer code (the renderer asserts the subset relation at compile time —
/// see src/renderer/menu/nativeMenu.ts).
///
/// Deliberately small. In-app menu items derive `disabled` from live state
/// (`busy`, `canUndo`, the live layer-count read, `exportLocked`); a native MenuItem is a
/// main-process object, so every one of those transitions would have to be
/// pushed over IPC and re-applied. That sync cost — not the labels — is what
/// full parity would buy.
