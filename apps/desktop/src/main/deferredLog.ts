/** Bounded producer-side buffer for LogBus entries emitted before a workspace —
 *  and therefore before a `LogBus` — exists. The MCP host binds at
 *  `app.whenReady()`, so its `listening` row has nothing to land in and Rust's
 *  `log_emit` drops it silently (`native/src/logs/bus.rs`); this holds it until
 *  the workspace-open path installs a bus.
 *
 *  Producer-side only: `LogBus`, `Clear` and `log_list` semantics are untouched
 *  (`docs/status-log.md`). Owns the bound and the replay
 *  order; owns no emit path of its own — the caller hands one to `flush`.
