// apps/desktop/src/main/state/migrate.ts
//
// The version-keyed upgrade chain for `project.json`. One step per schema
// generation, applied in sequence: v_n → v_n+1 → … → the build's version.
// `persistence.ts` owns the refusals (missing/non-numeric version, a file NEWER
// than the build) and calls in here for everything older.
//
// THE ONE RULE this file exists to enforce: a shape CONVERSION is a step here,
// with a version number attached. It is NOT an unconditional rewrite in
// `parseProject`. The version-blind normalize pass over there is for DEFAULTS
// (an additive optional field materializing) and VALIDITY REPAIRS (off-grid
// geometry, a flag that contradicts the data it describes) — both of which are
// idempotent statements about the *current* shape and carry no version. A
// conversion states "the shape used to be X and is now Y", which is exactly what
// a version number is for. Before this file existed the codebase had no way to
// say that, so three conversions rode the blind pass and the version never moved
// (see ADR 0047).
//
// WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING FROM ./model — and must keep importing nothing:
// a step is a frozen statement about a shape that has already passed into
// history. If a step read `SCHEMA_VERSION`, a type, or `defaultSettings()` from
// the live model, it would silently re-anchor to whatever the model looks like
// years later — the step's meaning would change without the step being edited,
// and the failure would only ever surface on a real user's old file. So every
// step works on the WIRE object (`Record<string, unknown>`), declares local
// types for just the fields it touches, and writes frozen literals. There is no
// linter in this repo; `migrate.contract.test.ts` asserts the import ban by
// reading this file's source.
//
// The runner — never a step — owns `schema_version`: a step that had to stamp
// its own output version could forget, and a forgotten stamp is silent (the next
// step's `from` would not match and the walk would report a hole that isn't one).
