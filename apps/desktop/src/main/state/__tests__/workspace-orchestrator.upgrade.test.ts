//
// The open path's schema-upgrade wiring: preserve the pre-upgrade bytes, then
// report.
//
// WHY THIS FILE MOCKS THE LOADER: at v1 the migration chain is empty, so no real
// project.json can arrive needing an upgrade — an older file is refused at the
// floor and a current one needs nothing. The wiring would therefore ship
// completely unexercised and first run for real on a user's v1 project years from
// now, at the exact moment its only job (keeping the original) matters. So the
// loader's `upgradedFrom` is forced here; everything else — the real parse, the
// real fs fake, the real handler order — is untouched. The mock lives in its own
// file so the main orchestrator suite keeps using the real module.
