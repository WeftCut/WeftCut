 *
 *  Lives beside `applyMoveLayer` because it is a lane change and nothing else:
 *  the new lane is the destination, not the subject. Z-order is rearranged by
 *  repeating this, and every repetition has to clean up after itself, which is
 *  the rule this file already owns.
 *
 *  Each layer keeps its `t_start_us` / `t_end_us` verbatim. No re-snap: an
 *  endpoint grid follows the layer's KIND, not its track, so times that were
 *  canonical stay canonical. That is also why `applyDurationAutofit` is NOT
 *  called — nothing is added, removed or retimed, so `max(t_end_us)` cannot
 *  move, and running it would fold unrelated duration drift into this entry.
 *
 *  Two same-class layers landing on top of each other is left to `validate`
 *  (`LayerOverlap`), which runs after this inside `commit`. The command's
 *  `enabled` predicate prevents that request up front; re-checking it here would
 *  give one rule two homes to drift between.
 *
 *  Link membership is untouched: `p.links` names layer ids and no invariant
 *  ties a link to a track, so the caller's explicit selection moves and nothing
 *  is dragged along — unlike `applyMoveLayer`, which has a time delta for
 *  siblings to follow. */
