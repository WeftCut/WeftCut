/** remove_transition — remove by id and undo the transition's OWN geometry,
 *  routed by provenance: shrink the outgoing layer's tail by `extended_us`
 *  (back to its sacred end S — only borrowed material is returned, never real
 *  content of a pre-positioned overlap) and move the incoming layer RIGHT by
 *  `duration_us − extended_us` (its link siblings following on their own
 *  lattices), restoring adjacency exactly: B.start′ = S = A.end′. Since e ≤ d
 *  the move is never negative, so B cannot cross 0 here.
 *
 *  A locked home lane refuses first (TrackLocked), then the restore move is
 *  pre-checked for destination collisions (TransitionRestoreCollision) — both
 *  BEFORE anything mutates; an unlocatable from_layer/to_layer skips that half
 *  (tolerance for a participant a prior edit removed). Like update, a
 *  following B→C transition broken by B's move is commit-reconcile's designed
 *  drop. */
