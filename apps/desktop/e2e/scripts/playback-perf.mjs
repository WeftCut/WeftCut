// Preview-playback performance matrix. LOCAL-ONLY, beside decode-bench.mjs and
// the memory ratchet, and opt-in for the same reason: it drives the real app for
// minutes per cell and profiles a GPU, so it must never enter the per-PR CI
// matrix.
//
// What it answers, and why decode-bench cannot: decode-bench measures ONE clip
// at the `DecodeSession` seam. This measures the WHOLE preview loop with N
// clips on N tracks — tick → anchor → composite → present — so it can say which
// STAGE is the wall and at what track count the wall is hit. The per-stage
// numbers come from `render/perf/stageTimers.ts`, which brackets the two costs
// `compositeMsLast` structurally cannot see (`setAnchorTime` and the Pixi
// present) plus the per-layer sub-stages inside the composite. The "Frame fate"
// table reports the other half — where each decoded frame WENT — from
// `FrameRing`'s `fate` (see `FrameRingFate`).
//
// Two crossed axes, both PINNED per cell and VERIFIED per layer via
// `activeClipProbe` before and after the measured window rather than trusted: a
// cell whose clips drifted off either pin reports the run invalid, so a
// downgraded lane can never be published under the label it drifted from.
//   route   — the three decode paths (`ROUTE_SPEC` below), all measured on ONE
//             fixture so a route comparison is never codec-confounded.
//   barrier — `--barrier`, pinned by WEFTCUT_HW_BARRIER and meaningful on the
//             hardware route ONLY. What each mode waits on, and which one the
//             product ships: `HwBarrierMode` in `src/shared/ipc.ts`.
//
// Every cell measures the ORIGINAL at full size, and pins that rather than
// assuming it: the composition is created at the fixture's own resolution,
// `playback_resolution` is pinned `full` (½/¼ would shrink both the raster
// target AND the shipped NV12), `prefer_proxies` is set false explicitly, a
// per-media proxy override forces Original, and each clip's `builtFromKey` is
// asserted to carry `:original:` rather than `:proxy:`.
//
// Run:
//   1. npm run napi:build && npm run napi:build:decode   (close the dev app — it locks the .node)
//   2. npm run build:e2e                                 (the __weftcutTest hook)
//   3. npm run bench:decode:fixtures                     (from e2e/, generates the fixtures)
//   4. npm run bench:playback                            (from e2e/)
//
// Run on a QUIET machine: the typeperf GPU-engine counters are machine-wide.
//
// Exit codes: 0 the matrix completed, 2 the run was invalid (no build, no hook,
// no fixture). Never non-zero because playback was slow — this is an
// instrument, not a gate.

// ── Stall probes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Two instruments for a `tickInterval` gap that no stage timer explains, run
// together because the pair is what attributes it.
//
// 1. `long-animation-frame` / `longtask`. Both fire only above 50 ms, and every
//    gap of interest here is 50–170 ms. A long *frame* carries the internal
//    split — `startTime` → `renderStart` (everything before the rendering steps,
//    which is where the rAF callbacks live) → `styleAndLayoutStart` → end — plus
//    per-script attribution for any script over the API's own 5 ms floor. So a
//    stall inside our JS names itself, and a stall with zero scripts and zero
//    long tasks says the time went somewhere that is not script at all.
//
// 2. A plain `setInterval` on the same main thread. This is what separates a
//    BLOCKED thread from one Chromium simply did not give a rendering
//    opportunity to: a timer cannot fire while the thread is blocked, and fires
//    right through a withheld `BeginMainFrame`. The period is coarse enough to
//    see a 50 ms+ stall and the callback is a single timestamp push, so it does
//    not become the thing being measured.
//
// Installed from the harness rather than from `stageTimers.ts` on purpose: a
// PerformanceObserver allocates per entry and a timer is a task, and that module
// is allocation-free while recording and has no business scheduling work.
